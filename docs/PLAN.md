## Preface: Understanding the Agent Flywheel

This section provides essential background for anyone reading this plan. Skip this if you're already familiar with the Agent Flywheel ecosystem.

### The Problem: AI Agents Working in Isolation

The AI coding agent revolution is here. Tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codex can write code, run tests, and even debug complex issues. But there's a fundamental problem:

**AI agents work in isolation.**

When you run Claude Code on a project, it operates alone. It doesn't know:
- What other agents are working on the same codebase
- What decisions were made in previous sessions
- Which files another agent is currently editing
- What patterns have worked (or failed) in similar past tasks
- Whether the code it's about to write will conflict with parallel work

This isolation creates waste:
- **Duplicate work** — Two agents solve the same problem differently
- **Merge conflicts** — Agents edit the same files simultaneously
- **Lost knowledge** — Insights from one session don't carry to the next
- **No coordination** — Agents can't delegate, escalate, or collaborate
- **Human bottleneck** — You become the message-passing middleware between agents

### The Vision: The Agent Flywheel

The **Agent Flywheel** is a self-improving development cycle where AI coding agents work in parallel, coordinate via messaging, and compound their learnings over time.

    Each revolution of the flywheel:
    • Agents have more context (from CASS/CM)
    • Work is better prioritized (from BV)
    • Conflicts are prevented (from Agent Mail)
    • Quality is maintained (from UBS)
    • Execution is faster (from Gateway optimizations)
```

The flywheel is **self-reinforcing**: each cycle generates knowledge that makes the next cycle faster and higher quality. Over time, the agents become more effective because they're building on accumulated intelligence rather than starting fresh each time.

### The Flywheel Tools

The Agent Flywheel is implemented through interconnected tools organized into core orchestration components and developer utilities. Understanding each tool is essential to understanding this plan.

#### 1. Flywheel Gateway (This Project)

**What it is:** The orchestration backbone—a web platform that spawns, monitors, and coordinates AI coding agents.

**Key responsibilities:**
- Spawn agents via multiple backends (SDK, ACP protocol, Tmux terminals)
- Stream agent output in real-time via WebSocket
- Manage agent lifecycle (pause, resume, checkpoint, terminate)
- Provide unified REST API for all flywheel tools
- Host the web UI for human visibility and control
- Manage BYOA accounts and rotate API keys when used (BYOK)
- Build "context packs" that give agents situational awareness

**Why it matters:** Without Gateway, agents are invisible black boxes. With Gateway, you have a command center showing what every agent is doing, with the ability to intervene when needed.

#### 2. Agent Mail

**What it is:** A messaging and coordination system for AI agents, implemented as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.

**Key responsibilities:**
- **Messaging:** Agents send messages to each other (project updates, questions, handoffs)
- **File Reservations:** Advisory locks that prevent edit conflicts ("I'm working on auth.ts")
- **Thread Management:** Conversations are threaded for context preservation
- **Project Identity:** Agents register under projects (working directory as identity)
- **Contact Policies:** Control which agents can message which others

**Key concepts:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it matters:** Without Agent Mail, agents step on each other's toes. With Agent Mail, they coordinate like a team—claiming work, signaling progress, and handing off context cleanly.

#### 3. bd (Beads)

**What it is:** An issue/task tracking system designed for AI-agent workflows. Think "GitHub Issues but optimized for agents."

**Key concepts:**
- **Bead:** A unit of work (bug, feature, task, chore)
- **Dependencies:** Beads can depend on other beads (forms a DAG)
- **Status:** draft → ready → in_progress → review → done
- **Metadata:** Priority, assignee (can be agent name), labels, time estimates

**Why "beads"?** The metaphor is a string of beads—work items threaded together by dependencies, forming a necklace of progress.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it matters:** Without structured task tracking, agents don't know what to work on. With Beads, they can query for ready work, understand dependencies, and update status as they progress.

#### 4. BV (Beads Visualization / Bead Voyager)

**What it is:** A graph-aware triage and analysis engine that sits on top of Beads. It provides intelligent recommendations about what to work on next.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Graph Analysis:** PageRank, betweenness centrality, HITS algorithm to find critical-path items
- **Triage Recommendations:** "Here are the 5 most impactful beads to work on now"
- **Blocking Analysis:** "These 3 beads are blocking the most other work"
- **Quick Wins:** "These beads are small and unblock multiple items"
- **Robot Mode:** JSON output for programmatic consumption by agents

**Example BV triage output:**
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "bead_id": "BEADS-4",
      "title": "Add authentication endpoints",
      "score": 0.92,
      "reasons": [
        "Unblocks 3 downstream beads",
        "High PageRank (critical path)",
        "Estimated 2-4 hours (reasonable scope)"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "quick_wins": [
    {
      "bead_id": "BEADS-7",
      "title": "Fix typo in error messages",
      "score": 0.78,
      "reasons": ["15 minutes", "No dependencies", "Improves UX"]
    }
  ],
  "blockers_to_clear": [
    {
      "bead_id": "BEADS-3",
      "blocking_count": 4,
      "assignee": "BlueLake",
      "status": "in_progress"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why it matters:** Without BV, agents pick work randomly or by recency. With BV, they work on what matters most—maximizing throughput through the dependency graph.

#### 5. UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)

**What it is:** A code quality and security scanning tool that catches issues before they compound.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Static Analysis:** Detect common bugs, anti-patterns, security vulnerabilities
- **Style Enforcement:** Ensure consistency across agent-written code
- **Complexity Metrics:** Flag overly complex functions
- **Security Scanning:** OWASP top 10, credential leaks, injection risks
- **Integration:** Can auto-create Beads from findings

**Scan categories:**
| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Security** | SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure crypto |
| **Quality** | Dead code, unused variables, unreachable branches |
| **Complexity** | Functions > 50 lines, cyclomatic complexity > 10 |
| **Style** | Inconsistent naming, missing error handling |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries, unbounded loops, memory leaks |

**Why it matters:** Agents write code fast, but they can introduce subtle bugs. UBS catches these before they accumulate into technical debt. It's the quality gate in the flywheel.

#### 6. CASS (Cross-Agent Session Search)

**What it is:** A semantic search engine that indexes past agent sessions, making historical knowledge discoverable.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Session Indexing:** Every agent conversation is indexed
- **Semantic Search:** "How did we handle OAuth last time?" → relevant sessions
- **Snippet Extraction:** Pull specific relevant portions, not entire sessions
- **Filtering:** By date, agent, project, tags, outcome (success/failure)
- **Privacy Controls:** Redact sensitive content before indexing

**Example query:**
```
Query: "rate limiting implementation"

Results:
1. Session 2024-12-15 (GreenCastle, my-api)
   "Implemented token bucket rate limiter in middleware..."
   Relevance: 0.94

2. Session 2024-11-28 (BlueLake, auth-service)
   "Added sliding window rate limit with Redis backend..."
   Relevance: 0.87

3. Session 2024-10-02 (RedStone, gateway)
   "Considered rate limiting approaches, chose leaky bucket..."
   Relevance: 0.71
```

**Why it matters:** Without CASS, agents reinvent solutions. With CASS, they can search "how did we solve X before?" and build on prior work.

#### 7. CM (Cass-Memory)

**What it is:** A procedural memory system that extracts rules, patterns, and playbooks from CASS sessions.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Rule Extraction:** "When doing X, always do Y" patterns from successful sessions
- **Anti-Pattern Detection:** "This approach failed 3 times, avoid it"
- **Playbook Generation:** Step-by-step guides derived from successful sessions
- **Context Retrieval:** "For this task, here are relevant memories"
- **Privacy-Respecting:** Generalizes without exposing sensitive specifics

**Example memories:**
```yaml
# Extracted from 47 sessions involving database migrations
- rule: "Always create a backup before running migrations"
  confidence: 0.95
  source_sessions: 47

- rule: "Test migrations on a copy of production data"
  confidence: 0.89
  source_sessions: 32

- anti_pattern: "Don't run migrations during peak traffic"
  failures: 3
  description: "Caused 2 outages when tried during business hours"
```

**Why it matters:** CASS gives you search; CM gives you wisdom. It's the difference between "here are past sessions" and "here's what we learned from them."

#### 8. CAAM (Credential/Account Automation Manager)

**What it is:** A system for managing **BYOA subscription accounts** (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) with optional BYOK (API key) support.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Profile Vault:** Tenant‑local OAuth artifacts managed by CAAM (never centralized)
- **Pool Management:** Multiple profiles per provider for rotation
- **Auto‑Rotation:** When an account hits a limit, switch to the next profile
- **Usage Tracking:** Track rate limits and cooldowns by profile
- **Health Monitoring:** Detect expired tokens, rate limits, and auth failures

**Example pool (profiles, not API keys):**

│  Next: alice@gmail (auto‑rotate on rate limit)                  │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why it matters:** Agents consume API tokens fast. Without CAAM, you hit rate limits and stall. With CAAM, you have automatic failover across multiple keys and providers.

#### 9. SLB (Safety Layer/Boundary)

**What it is:** Safety guardrails that prevent dangerous operations and enforce human oversight for risky actions.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Two-Person Rule:** Dangerous operations require human approval
- **Operation Classification:** Safe, risky, dangerous, forbidden
- **Approval Workflows:** Request → Review → Approve/Deny
- **Audit Trail:** Every approval decision is logged
- **Timeout Handling:** Auto-deny if no response within window

**Example dangerous operations:**
| Operation | Risk Level | Requires |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| `rm -rf /` | FORBIDDEN | Blocked always |
| `git push --force main` | DANGEROUS | Human approval |
| `DROP TABLE users` | DANGEROUS | Human approval |
| `git reset --hard` | RISKY | Warning + confirmation |
| `npm install` | SAFE | Auto-approved |

**Why it matters:** Autonomous agents are powerful but can make catastrophic mistakes. SLB ensures humans stay in the loop for irreversible actions.

#### 10. RU (Repo Updater)

**What it is:** A production-grade Bash CLI (~17,700 LOC) for managing large collections of GitHub repositories with AI-assisted review and agent automation capabilities.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Multi-repo sync:** Clone & pull 100+ repos with parallel processing (`-j N`)
- **AI code review:** Orchestrates Claude Code sessions via ntm for PR/issue review
- **Agent-sweep:** Three-phase automated workflow per repository (analyze → plan → execute)
- **Conflict detection:** Identifies diverged, dirty, and conflicted repos with actionable resolution
- **Preflight safety:** Blocks unsafe states (detached HEAD, merge in progress, secrets detected)

**Agent-sweep workflow:**
```
Phase 1: Deep Understanding (300s)
    ↓ Agent reads AGENTS.md, README.md, git log
Phase 2: Plan Generation (600s)
    ↓ Agent produces commit/release plans in structured JSON
Phase 3: Validation & Execution (300s)
    ↓ RU validates plans, runs preflight checks, executes git operations
```

**Why it matters:** Managing dozens of repositories manually is tedious and error-prone. RU automates sync, enables AI-driven maintenance across entire repository fleets, and integrates with ntm for session orchestration.

#### 11. DCG (Destructive Command Guard)

**What it is:** A high-performance Rust pre-execution hook (<1ms latency) for Claude Code that blocks catastrophic commands before they run.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Modular pack system:** git, filesystem, database, containers, kubernetes, cloud, terraform
- **Context-aware:** Distinguishes executed code from data strings (dramatically reduces false positives)
- **Severity tiers:** Critical (always block), High (allowlistable), Medium (warn), Low (log)
- **Claude Code integration:** PreToolUse hook that intercepts Bash commands

**Example blocked operations:**
| Command | Pack | Severity |
|---------|------|----------|
| `git reset --hard` | core.git | Critical |
| `rm -rf ./` | core.filesystem | Critical |
| `docker system prune -af` | containers.docker | High |
| `DROP DATABASE production` | database.postgresql | Critical |
| `kubectl delete namespace prod` | kubernetes.kubectl | Critical |

**Why it matters:** DCG is the mechanical enforcement layer that protects against honest mistakes. Unlike AGENTS.md instructions which agents might ignore, DCG physically prevents destructive commands from executing. It replaces simpler Python-based approaches with sub-millisecond Rust performance.

#### Developer Utilities

These tools enhance AI agent workflows and should be auto-installed in agent environments:

#### giil (Get Image from Internet Link)

**What it is:** A zero-setup CLI that downloads full-resolution images from cloud photo sharing services.

**Key capabilities:**
- **4-tier capture strategy:** Download button → CDN interception → element screenshot → viewport
- **Supported platforms:** iCloud, Dropbox, Google Photos, Google Drive
- **Image processing:** MozJPEG compression, EXIF datetime extraction, HEIC conversion
- **Remote-friendly:** Perfect for SSH sessions where agents need to analyze screenshots

**Why it matters:** When debugging UI issues remotely, agents need to see screenshots. giil bridges the gap—paste an iCloud link, run one command, agent immediately analyzes the image.

#### csctf (Chat Shared Conversation to File)

**What it is:** A single-binary CLI for converting public AI chat share links into clean Markdown and HTML transcripts.

**Key capabilities:**
- **Multi-provider:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude.ai
- **Code-preserving:** Fenced blocks with language detection
- **GitHub Pages:** One-command publish to static microsite
- **Deterministic:** Collision-proof filenames, atomic writes

**Why it matters:** AI conversations contain valuable problem-solving context. csctf captures this knowledge as searchable, archivable documents that can feed back into CASS for future retrieval.

### How the Tools Work Together

The flywheel tools form a cohesive system where each tool amplifies the others:

Data flows:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. BV analyzes Beads → recommends work → Agent claims via Agent Mail
2. Agent starts work → Gateway spawns execution → reserves files via Agent Mail
3. Agent completes → UBS scans output → creates new Beads for findings
4. Session indexed by CASS → CM extracts rules → improves future context packs
5. All operations use CAAM for account profiles (BYOA) and API keys when needed (BYOK) → SLB for safety checks
6. Gateway provides unified API for everything → Web UI visualizes it all
```

### The Flywheel in Action: An Example

Let's walk through a concrete example of how the flywheel operates:

**Scenario:** A team wants to add user authentication to their app. They have three AI agents available.

```
HOUR 0: Setup
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Human creates beads:
  BEADS-1: "Design auth schema" (ready)
  BEADS-2: "Implement user model" (depends on BEADS-1)
  BEADS-3: "Add login endpoint" (depends on BEADS-2)
  BEADS-4: "Add registration endpoint" (depends on BEADS-2)
  BEADS-5: "Write auth tests" (depends on BEADS-3, BEADS-4)

BV triage recommends: "Start with BEADS-1, it unblocks everything"

HOUR 1: First Agent Starts
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GreenCastle (Claude Opus 4.5):
  1. Queries BV → gets BEADS-1 as top recommendation
  2. Claims BEADS-1 via Agent Mail
  3. Reserves db/schema.sql via Agent Mail
  4. Gateway spawns agent with context pack:
     - Task: BEADS-1 description
     - Memory: "Always use UUID for user IDs" (from CM)
     - Similar session: "Auth schema from project-X" (from CASS)
  5. Completes work, marks BEADS-1 done
  6. UBS scans changes → no issues found

HOUR 2: Parallel Execution Begins
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BV updates: "BEADS-2 is now ready and high priority"

BlueLake (Codex):
  1. Queries BV → gets BEADS-2
  2. Claims BEADS-2, reserves src/models/user.ts
  3. Works on user model implementation

GreenCastle (now idle):
  1. Queries BV → no ready work yet (BEADS-3,4 depend on BEADS-2)
  2. Messages BlueLake: "Let me know when BEADS-2 is done"
  3. Waits or works on unrelated beads

HOUR 3: Dependencies Resolve
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
BlueLake completes BEADS-2
  → BV immediately updates: BEADS-3 and BEADS-4 are now ready
  → Agent Mail notifies GreenCastle

GreenCastle and RedStone (new agent):
  1. GreenCastle claims BEADS-3 (login), reserves src/api/login.ts
  2. RedStone claims BEADS-4 (registration), reserves src/api/register.ts
  3. Both work in parallel—no conflicts because files are reserved

HOUR 4: Quality Gate
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
GreenCastle completes BEADS-3
RedStone completes BEADS-4

UBS scans both:
  - GreenCastle's code: ✅ Clean
  - RedStone's code: ⚠️ "SQL injection risk in email validation"
    → Auto-creates BEADS-6: "Fix SQL injection in registration"
    → BEADS-5 now also depends on BEADS-6

HOUR 5: Remediation and Completion
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RedStone fixes BEADS-6 (quick win, 10 minutes)
UBS re-scans: ✅ Clean

BV: "BEADS-5 (auth tests) is now ready"

BlueLake claims BEADS-5, writes comprehensive tests
All tests pass → Feature complete!

HOUR 6: Knowledge Capture
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CASS indexes all 5 sessions from this sprint

CM extracts new rules:
  - "Use parameterized queries for email validation"
  - "Include rate limiting on registration endpoints"
  - "Auth schemas should include created_at/updated_at"

Next time any agent works on authentication:
  → These rules appear in their context pack
  → They don't repeat the SQL injection mistake
  → The flywheel has improved
```

### The Philosophy: Why This Approach?

Several philosophical principles guide the Agent Flywheel design:

#### 1. Agents as First-Class Citizens

Traditional tooling treats AI as an afterthought—"maybe we'll add an API later." The flywheel treats agents as **primary users**:
- Every operation has a REST API
- OpenAPI specs include agent-specific hints
- Error messages are designed to be actionable by agents
- The system is observable and introspectable

#### 2. Coordination Over Control

Rather than trying to "control" agents with rigid rules, we focus on **coordination**:
- File reservations are advisory, not mandatory
- Agents can message each other to resolve conflicts
- The system provides information; agents make decisions

#### 3. Memory as Infrastructure

Knowledge shouldn't be trapped in individual sessions:
- CASS makes all sessions searchable
- CM extracts generalizable knowledge
- Context packs deliver relevant memories at the right time
- The system gets smarter with every session

#### 4. Safety Through Visibility

Rather than trying to prevent all mistakes (impossible), we focus on:
- Making agent activity visible (Gateway UI)
- Catching issues early (UBS scanning)
- Requiring approval for dangerous operations (SLB)
- Maintaining audit trails for review

#### 5. Self-Hosting and Control

The flywheel is designed to run on your infrastructure:
- No vendor lock-in; BYOA (Bring Your Own Account) with optional BYOK (API keys)
- All data stays on your servers
- Open protocols (MCP, ACP) for interoperability
- Can run on cheap bare-metal (any VPS or dedicated server provider)

**Key terminology:**
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Agent** | An AI coding assistant (Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.) |
| **Session** | A single conversation/task execution with an agent |
| **Bead** | A unit of work (task, bug, feature) |
| **Context Pack** | Pre-assembled prompt with triage, memory, search results |
| **Driver** | Backend for agent execution (SDK, ACP, Tmux) |

---

## North-Star Vision

Flywheel Gateway becomes a **multi-agent command center that lives everywhere**:

- **SDK-first** — Direct integration with Claude Agent SDK, Codex SDK, Gemini SDK
- **Protocol-aware** — Native ACP (Agent Client Protocol) support for IDE integration
- **Terminal-fallback** — Tmux support for power users who want visual terminals
- **Web-first** (desktop + mobile) for visibility, orchestration, and "at-a-glance" control
- **API-first** (REST + WebSocket) so humans *and agents* can automate anything

### Non-Negotiable Requirement

> **Every agent operation must be possible via REST.**
> No "hidden features" locked to a specific driver. No drift. No "you can only do that with SDK mode."

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to build Flywheel Gateway as a full-featured web platform for multi-agent orchestration. Flywheel Gateway is the **orchestration backbone** of the Agent Flywheel—a self-improving development cycle where AI coding agents work in parallel, coordinate via messaging, and compound their learnings over time.

The architecture introduces:

1. **Agent Driver Abstraction** — SDK, ACP, and Tmux backends behind a unified interface
2. **Command Registry & Parity Gate** — Single source of truth for REST, WebSocket, tRPC, and OpenAPI (with AI hints)
3. **REST API Layer** — A performant, well-documented HTTP API across **all flywheel tools**
4. **WebSocket Layer** — Real-time streaming with durable buffering, ack/replay, and cursor-based resume
5. **Job Orchestration** — First-class handling for long-running operations with progress events
6. **Web UI Layer** — A world-class Vite 7.3 / React 19.2 interface with Stripe-level polish, providing unified access to the entire flywheel ecosystem
7. **Supervisor System** — Lifecycle management for flywheel daemons
8. **Context Pack Engine** — Token-budgeted prompt assembly from triage, memory, search, and session data
9. **Checkpoint & Restore** — Agent state management and disaster recovery
10. **Conflict Detection** — Real-time file conflict detection and resolution between agents
11. **Structured Logging & Audit** — Correlation IDs, redaction, and audit trails for all mutations

The design prioritizes:
- **SDK-first execution** — Direct API calls for programmatic control
- **Protocol flexibility** — Agent Driver abstraction supports multiple backends
- **Flywheel acceleration** — Every feature designed to make the virtuous cycle spin faster
- **Full ecosystem integration** — Agent Mail, BV, UBS, CASS, CM, CAAM, SLB unified under one UI
- **Real-time reliability** — Durable, replayable event streams with ack for critical events
- **API parity** — Registry-driven OpenAPI with enforced AI hints and examples
- **Auditability by default** — Structured logs and correlated audit trails across all mutations
- **Visual excellence** — Desktop and mobile-optimized UX with separate interaction paradigms

## 1. Product Outcomes

### 1.1 Outcomes for Humans

1. **One-page clarity:**
   In < 10 seconds, you can answer:
   - Which agents are active / stalled / erroring?
   - Which execution contexts are producing output now?
   - Where are conflicts forming?
   - Which prompts were recently sent?
   - What's the overall health of the flywheel?

2. **"Stripe-level" UI polish and confidence:**
   The UI should feel inevitable, crisp, and *calm*—even while coordinating chaos.

3. **Mobile becomes genuinely useful (not "just a viewer"):**
   - Triage alerts, restart agents, broadcast prompts, view recent output, resolve conflicts
   - Do all that safely (access controls + approvals)

### 1.2 Outcomes for Agents / Automation

1. **OpenAPI that teaches itself**
   - Every endpoint has: clear description, realistic examples, error cases, when/why to use it
   - Agents should be able to "just read the spec" and act correctly

2. **WebSocket stream as a universal feed**
   - Agent output, activity states, tool calls/results
   - Notifications, file changes + conflicts, checkpoints + history
   - All in a consistent event envelope with replay/resume

### 2.2 The Flywheel Tools

#### Core Orchestration Tools

| # | Tool | Purpose | Integration Priority |
|---|------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Flywheel Gateway** | Agent orchestration & execution | Core (this project) |
| 2 | **Agent Mail** | Agent messaging & file coordination | Critical |
| 3 | **BV** | Task management & graph analysis | Critical |
| 4 | **UBS** | Code quality scanning | High |
| 5 | **CASS** | Session history search & indexing | High |
| 6 | **CM** | Procedural memory for agents | High |
| 7 | **CAAM** | BYOA/BYOK account profile rotation | Medium |
| 8 | **SLB** | Safety guardrails (two-person rule) | Medium |
| 9 | **RU** | Multi-repo sync & AI agent-sweep automation | High |
| 10 | **DCG** | Pre-execution hook blocking catastrophic commands | Critical |

#### Developer Utilities

These tools enhance AI agent workflows and should be auto-installed in agent environments:

| Tool | Purpose | Auto-Install |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **giil** | Download cloud photos (iCloud, Dropbox, Google) for AI visual analysis | Yes |
| **csctf** | Convert AI chat share links to Markdown/HTML transcripts | Yes |

### 2.3 How The Web UI Accelerates The Flywheel

The web UI transforms each phase:

| Phase | CLI Experience | Web UI Experience |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **PLAN** | `bv` TUI, `bd ready` | Visual Kanban, dependency graph, drag-drop prioritization |
| **COORDINATE** | `am` commands, inbox polling | Real-time chat, file reservation map, @mentions |
| **EXECUTE** | SDK/tmux spawning | Visual agent grid, live output, one-click spawn |
| **SCAN** | `ubs .` output | Dashboard with severity charts, inline annotations |
| **REMEMBER** | `cm context`, `cass search` | Semantic search UI, memory timeline, rule browser |

### 2.4 Design Principle: Flywheel-First

Every feature should answer: **"Does this make the flywheel spin faster?"**

- ✅ Real-time file reservation map → Prevents conflicts, faster coordination
- ✅ Visual dependency graph → Better prioritization, faster planning
- ✅ Inline UBS annotations → Faster bug fixing, better quality
- ✅ Memory search UI → Faster context retrieval, better first attempts
- ❌ Pretty animations with no function → Slower page loads, distraction

## 3. Technology Stack

### 3.1 Core Technologies

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Runtime** | Bun 1.3+ | Fast, native TypeScript, built-in SQLite, WebSocket |
| **Language** | TypeScript 5.9+ (strict) | Type safety, same language as agent SDKs |
| **HTTP Server** | Hono 4.11+ | Ultrafast, Bun-native, middleware ecosystem |
| **API** | tRPC 11+ | End-to-end type safety, works with TanStack Query |
| **Database** | Drizzle ORM 0.45+ + bun:sqlite | TypeScript-native, fast, zero-config |
| **WebSocket** | Bun Native WebSocket | Built-in, performant |
| **Event Bus** | In-memory pub/sub | Custom, ring buffer history |

### 3.2 Frontend Technologies

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Build Tool** | Vite 7.3+ | Fast, simple, no SSR complexity (Vite 8 beta with Rolldown available) |
| **Framework** | React 19.2+ | Latest features, Compiler stable |
| **Routing** | TanStack Router 1.145+ | Type-safe, file-based |
| **Server State** | TanStack Query 5.90+ | Caching, streaming, optimistic updates |
| **Client State** | Zustand | Simple, efficient |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 4.1+ | Utility-first, CSS-based config |

| **Terminal** | xterm.js | Full terminal emulation |
| **Graphs** | React Flow (@xyflow/react) | Dependency visualization |
| **Charts** | Recharts | Dashboard visualizations |

### 3.3 Agent SDKs

| SDK | Package | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **Claude Agent SDK** | `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` | Primary agent backend |
| **Codex SDK** | `@openai/codex-sdk` | OpenAI Codex integration |
| **Google GenAI** | `@google/genai` | Gemini integration |

### 3.4 Why Vite Over Next.js

For a dashboard/control panel application:

1. **No SEO needed** — This is an internal tool, not a content site
2. **No SSR needed** — Real-time data via WebSocket, not server rendering
3. **Simpler mental model** — No server components, no hydration complexity
4. **Faster dev experience** — Vite's HMR is instant
5. **Smaller bundle** — No Next.js runtime overhead
6. **Same features** — TanStack Router gives us file-based routing

### 4.2 Design Principles

1. **SDK-first execution** — Direct API calls, no terminal overhead
2. **Protocol flexibility** — Agent Driver abstraction supports multiple backends
3. **Flywheel-first** — Every feature accelerates the virtuous cycle
4. **Streaming-first** — WebSocket for all real-time data; REST for commands/queries
5. **Unified ecosystem** — All flywheel tools accessible from single UI
6. **Type-safe end-to-end** — TypeScript from database to UI
7. **Progressive enhancement** — Web UI enhances but doesn't replace CLI workflows

### 4.3 Key Architectural Invariants

- **No silent data loss** — All operations preserve data integrity
- **Idempotency** for automation: repeated calls shouldn't spam agents
- **All operations are auditable**: every API mutation creates a history entry and emits an event
- **API parity is mandatory**: all capabilities originate in the Command Registry and pass the parity gate
- **Critical events are durable and replayable**: ack/replay for approvals, conflicts, and other high-stakes topics
- **Everything is streamable**: if it matters, it emits events and/or is queryable

### 4.4 API Parity Guarantee: The Command Registry

A central design principle ensures that **all operations are defined once and exposed consistently** across REST, WebSocket, and tRPC interfaces. This prevents API drift and guarantees that any capability available through one interface is available through all.

#### The Command Registry Pattern

Every operation in Flywheel Gateway is registered in a central registry that drives code generation:

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/commands/registry.ts

interface CommandDefinition<TInput, TOutput> {
  // Identity
  name: string;                    // e.g., 'agents.spawn'
  category: CommandCategory;       // 'agents' | 'mail' | 'beads' | 'scanner' | etc.
  description: string;

  // Schemas (Zod)
  inputSchema: z.ZodType<TInput>;
  outputSchema: z.ZodType<TOutput>;

  // REST binding
  rest: {
    method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE';
    path: string;                  // e.g., '/agents'
    pathParams?: string[];         // e.g., ['id'] for '/agents/{id}'
  };

  // WebSocket binding (optional)
  ws?: {
    emitsEvents: string[];         // Events this command triggers
    subscribeTopic?: string;       // Topic for streaming results
  };

  // Behavior metadata
  idempotent: boolean;
  safetyLevel: 'safe' | 'requires_confirmation' | 'dangerous';
  longRunning: boolean;            // Returns job ID instead of result

  // Documentation for AI agents
  aiHints: {
    whenToUse: string;
    commonMistakes: string[];
    prerequisites: string[];       // Commands to call first
    followUp: string[];            // Commands typically called after
  };

  // Handler
  handler: (ctx: Context, input: TInput) => Promise<TOutput>;
}

// Example registration
export const spawnAgent = defineCommand({
  name: 'agents.spawn',
  category: 'agents',
  description: 'Spawn a new AI coding agent',

  inputSchema: z.object({
    model: z.enum(['claude', 'codex', 'gemini']),
    workingDir: z.string(),
    driver: z.enum(['sdk', 'acp', 'tmux']).optional(),
    contextPack: z.string().optional(),
  }),

  outputSchema: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    model: z.string(),
    status: z.enum(['starting', 'running']),
    driver: z.string(),
  }),

  rest: {
    method: 'POST',
    path: '/agents',
  },

  ws: {
    emitsEvents: ['agent.spawned', 'agent.state_changed'],
    subscribeTopic: 'agents:{id}',
  },

  idempotent: false,
  safetyLevel: 'safe',
  longRunning: false,

  aiHints: {
    whenToUse: 'When you need to start a new coding agent to work on a task',
    commonMistakes: [
      'Not specifying workingDir (defaults to cwd)',
      'Spawning multiple agents on same file without coordination',
    ],
    prerequisites: [],
    followUp: ['agents.send', 'reservations.create'],
  },

  handler: async (ctx, input) => {
    return ctx.agentService.spawn(input);
  },
});
```

#### Code Generation from Registry

The registry enables automatic generation of:

1. **REST Routes** — Hono routes with Zod validation
2. **tRPC Procedures** — Type-safe procedures with inference
3. **OpenAPI Spec** — Complete spec with examples and AI hints
4. **TypeScript Client** — Fully typed API client
5. **WebSocket Handlers** — Event subscription setup

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/routes/generated.ts (auto-generated)

import { commands } from '@flywheel/shared/commands';
import { Hono } from 'hono';

export const generatedRoutes = new Hono();

for (const cmd of commands) {
  const { method, path } = cmd.rest;

  generatedRoutes[method.toLowerCase()](path, async (c) => {
    const input = await c.req.json();
    const validated = cmd.inputSchema.parse(input);
    const result = await cmd.handler(c, validated);
    return c.json({ data: result, request_id: c.get('requestId') });
  });
}
```

#### Parity Gate: CI Enforcement

The build fails if parity is violated:

```typescript
// scripts/parity-check.ts

import { commands, CommandDefinition } from '@flywheel/shared/commands';

const violations: string[] = [];

for (const cmd of commands) {
  // Every command must have REST binding
  if (!cmd.rest) {
    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Missing REST binding`);
  }

  // Every command must have AI hints
  if (!cmd.aiHints?.whenToUse) {
    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Missing AI hints`);
  }

  // Destructive commands must not be 'safe'
  if (cmd.rest?.method === 'DELETE' && cmd.safetyLevel === 'safe') {
    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: DELETE should not be marked 'safe'`);
  }

  // Long-running commands must specify job handling
  if (cmd.longRunning && !cmd.outputSchema.shape.jobId) {
    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Long-running command must return jobId`);
  }
}

if (violations.length > 0) {
  console.error('❌ Parity violations detected:');
  violations.forEach(v => console.error(`  - ${v}`));
  process.exit(1);
}

console.log('✅ All commands pass parity checks');
```

This pattern ensures that **new features automatically get full API coverage** — if a developer adds a command to the registry, it's immediately available via REST, WebSocket, and tRPC.

## 5. Supervisor & Daemon Management

### 5.1 The Problem

Flywheel Gateway depends on external daemons (Agent Mail MCP server, CM server, bd daemon). These need lifecycle management.

### 5.2 Supervisor Service

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/services/supervisor.service.ts

interface DaemonSpec {
  name: string;
  command: string[];
  port?: number;
  healthEndpoint?: string;
  restartPolicy: 'always' | 'on-failure' | 'never';
  maxRestarts: number;
  restartDelayMs: number;
}

const DEFAULT_SPECS: DaemonSpec[] = [
  {
    name: 'agent-mail',
    command: ['mcp-agent-mail', 'serve'],
    port: 8765,
    healthEndpoint: '/health',
    restartPolicy: 'always',
    maxRestarts: 5,
    restartDelayMs: 1000,
  },
  {
    name: 'cm-server',
    command: ['cm', 'serve'],
    port: 8766,
    healthEndpoint: '/health',
    restartPolicy: 'always',
    maxRestarts: 5,
    restartDelayMs: 1000,
  },
  {
    name: 'bd-daemon',
    command: ['bd', 'daemon'],
    restartPolicy: 'on-failure',
    maxRestarts: 3,
    restartDelayMs: 2000,
  },
];

interface DaemonState {
  name: string;
  status: 'starting' | 'running' | 'stopping' | 'stopped' | 'failed';
  pid?: number;
  port?: number;
  startedAt?: Date;
  restartCount: number;
  lastHealthCheck?: Date;
  lastError?: string;
}

export class SupervisorService {
  private daemons = new Map<string, DaemonState>();
  private processes = new Map<string, Subprocess>();

  async startAll(): Promise<void> {
    for (const spec of DEFAULT_SPECS) {
      await this.startDaemon(spec);
    }
  }

  async startDaemon(spec: DaemonSpec): Promise<void> {
    const proc = Bun.spawn(spec.command, {
      stdout: 'pipe',
      stderr: 'pipe',
      onExit: (proc, exitCode) => this.handleExit(spec, exitCode),
    });

    this.processes.set(spec.name, proc);
    this.daemons.set(spec.name, {
      name: spec.name,
      status: 'starting',
      pid: proc.pid,
      port: spec.port,
      startedAt: new Date(),
      restartCount: 0,
    });

    // Start health check loop
    if (spec.healthEndpoint) {
      this.startHealthCheck(spec);
    }
  }

  async stopDaemon(name: string): Promise<void> {
    const proc = this.processes.get(name);
    if (proc) {
      proc.kill();
      this.daemons.set(name, { ...this.daemons.get(name)!, status: 'stopped' });
    }
  }

  async getStatus(): Promise<DaemonState[]> {
    return Array.from(this.daemons.values());
  }

  private async handleExit(spec: DaemonSpec, exitCode: number | null): Promise<void> {
    const state = this.daemons.get(spec.name)!;

    if (spec.restartPolicy === 'always' ||
        (spec.restartPolicy === 'on-failure' && exitCode !== 0)) {
      if (state.restartCount < spec.maxRestarts) {
        state.restartCount++;
        state.status = 'starting';
        await Bun.sleep(spec.restartDelayMs);
        await this.startDaemon(spec);
      } else {
        state.status = 'failed';
        state.lastError = `Max restarts (${spec.maxRestarts}) exceeded`;
        this.emitEvent('daemon.failed', state);
      }
    } else {
      state.status = 'stopped';
    }
  }

  private startHealthCheck(spec: DaemonSpec): void {
    const interval = setInterval(async () => {
      try {
        const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:${spec.port}${spec.healthEndpoint}`);
        const state = this.daemons.get(spec.name)!;
        if (res.ok && state.status === 'starting') {
          state.status = 'running';
          this.emitEvent('daemon.started', state);
        }
        state.lastHealthCheck = new Date();
      } catch {
        // Health check failed - daemon may be starting or crashed
      }
    }, 5000);
  }

  private emitEvent(type: string, data: DaemonState): void {
    // Emit to WebSocket hub
    eventBus.emit({ type, data });
  }
}
```

### 5.3 REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/supervisor/status` | All daemon statuses |
| `POST` | `/supervisor/{name}/start` | Start daemon |
| `POST` | `/supervisor/{name}/stop` | Stop daemon |
| `POST` | `/supervisor/{name}/restart` | Restart daemon |
| `GET` | `/supervisor/{name}/logs` | Daemon logs |

### 5.4 WebSocket Events

```typescript
interface SupervisorEvent {
  type: 'daemon.started' | 'daemon.stopped' | 'daemon.failed' | 'daemon.health_changed';
  data: {
    name: string;
    status: DaemonState['status'];
    pid?: number;
    error?: string;
  };
}
```

## 6. Agent Driver Abstraction

### 6.1 The Driver Interface

The Agent Driver abstraction allows Flywheel Gateway to support multiple execution backends:

```typescript
// packages/agent-drivers/src/types.ts

interface AgentDriver {
  readonly type: 'sdk' | 'acp' | 'tmux';

  spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent>;
  send(agentId: string, message: string): Promise<void>;
  interrupt(agentId: string): Promise<void>;
  getOutput(agentId: string, since?: Date): Promise<OutputLine[]>;
  subscribe(agentId: string): AsyncIterable<AgentEvent>;
  terminate(agentId: string): Promise<void>;

  // Driver-specific capabilities
  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities;
}

interface AgentConfig {
  model: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';
  workingDir: string;
  systemPrompt?: string;
  tools?: ToolConfig[];
  agentMailIdentity?: string;
}

interface Agent {
  id: string;
  driver: AgentDriver['type'];
  config: AgentConfig;
  status: 'spawning' | 'idle' | 'working' | 'error' | 'terminated';
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
}

interface AgentEvent {
  type: 'output' | 'tool_call' | 'tool_result' | 'state_change' | 'error';
  timestamp: Date;
  agentId: string;
  data: unknown;
}

interface DriverCapabilities {
  supportsStructuredEvents: boolean;
  supportsToolCalls: boolean;
  supportsFileOperations: boolean;
  supportsTerminalAttach: boolean;
  supportsDiffRendering: boolean;
}
```

### 6.2 SDK Driver (Primary)

The SDK Driver uses agent SDKs directly for programmatic control:

```typescript
// packages/agent-drivers/src/sdk/driver.ts

import { ClaudeClient } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';

export class SDKDriver implements AgentDriver {
  readonly type = 'sdk' as const;

  private claudeClient: ClaudeClient;
  private agents = new Map<string, SDKAgent>();

  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent> {
    const client = this.getClientForModel(config.model);

    const session = await client.createSession({
      workingDirectory: config.workingDir,
      systemPrompt: config.systemPrompt,
    });

    const agent: Agent = {
      id: session.id,
      driver: 'sdk',
      config,
      status: 'idle',
      createdAt: new Date(),
      lastActivity: new Date(),
    };

    this.agents.set(agent.id, { agent, session });
    return agent;
  }

  async send(agentId: string, message: string): Promise<void> {
    const { session } = this.agents.get(agentId)!;
    await session.sendMessage(message);
  }

  async *subscribe(agentId: string): AsyncIterable<AgentEvent> {
    const { session } = this.agents.get(agentId)!;

    for await (const event of session.events()) {
      yield this.mapSDKEvent(agentId, event);
    }
  }

  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities {
    return {
      supportsStructuredEvents: true,
      supportsToolCalls: true,
      supportsFileOperations: true,
      supportsTerminalAttach: false,
      supportsDiffRendering: false,
    };
  }

  private mapSDKEvent(agentId: string, event: SDKEvent): AgentEvent {
    return {
      type: this.mapEventType(event.type),
      timestamp: new Date(),
      agentId,
      data: event.data,
    };
  }
}
```

### 6.3 ACP Driver (Structured Events)

The ACP Driver implements the Agent Client Protocol for IDE-compatible structured events:

```typescript
// packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/driver.ts

import { spawn } from 'bun';

export class ACPDriver implements AgentDriver {
  readonly type = 'acp' as const;

  private processes = new Map<string, ACPProcess>();

  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent> {
    // Spawn ACP-compatible agent via stdio
    const proc = spawn({
      cmd: this.getACPCommand(config.model),
      stdin: 'pipe',
      stdout: 'pipe',
      stderr: 'pipe',
      cwd: config.workingDir,
    });

    const agent: Agent = {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      driver: 'acp',
      config,
      status: 'idle',
      createdAt: new Date(),
      lastActivity: new Date(),
    };

    this.processes.set(agent.id, { agent, proc, rpc: new JSONRPCClient(proc) });
    return agent;
  }

  async send(agentId: string, message: string): Promise<void> {
    const { rpc } = this.processes.get(agentId)!;
    await rpc.call('agent/send', { message });
  }

  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities {
    return {
      supportsStructuredEvents: true,
      supportsToolCalls: true,
      supportsFileOperations: true,
      supportsTerminalAttach: false,
      supportsDiffRendering: true,  // ACP has diff rendering types
    };
  }
}
```

### 6.4 Tmux Driver (Fallback)

The Tmux Driver supports users who want visual terminal access:

```typescript
// packages/agent-drivers/src/tmux/driver.ts

export class TmuxDriver implements AgentDriver {
  readonly type = 'tmux' as const;

  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent> {
    const sessionName = `flywheel-${Date.now()}`;

    // Create tmux session
    await $`tmux new-session -d -s ${sessionName} -c ${config.workingDir}`;

    // Start the appropriate CLI in the pane
    const cmd = this.getCLICommand(config.model);
    await $`tmux send-keys -t ${sessionName} ${cmd} Enter`;

    const agent: Agent = {
      id: sessionName,
      driver: 'tmux',
      config,
      status: 'idle',
      createdAt: new Date(),
      lastActivity: new Date(),
    };

    return agent;
  }

  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities {
    return {
      supportsStructuredEvents: false,  // Text parsing only
      supportsToolCalls: false,
      supportsFileOperations: false,
      supportsTerminalAttach: true,     // Can attach visual terminal
      supportsDiffRendering: false,
    };
  }
}
```

### 6.5 Driver Selection Strategy

```typescript
// packages/agent-drivers/src/index.ts

export function selectDriver(
  preference: 'sdk' | 'acp' | 'tmux' | 'auto',
  config: AgentConfig
): AgentDriver {
  if (preference === 'auto') {
    // SDK is preferred for programmatic control
    if (hasSDKSupport(config.model)) return new SDKDriver();
    // ACP for structured events without full SDK
    if (hasACPAdapter(config.model)) return new ACPDriver();
    // Tmux as fallback
    return new TmuxDriver();
  }

  switch (preference) {
    case 'sdk': return new SDKDriver();
    case 'acp': return new ACPDriver();
    case 'tmux': return new TmuxDriver();
  }
}
```

## 7. Agent Lifecycle Management

### 7.1 Activity States

```typescript
type ActivityState =
  | 'idle'           // Waiting for input
  | 'thinking'       // Processing, no output yet
  | 'working'        // Actively producing output
  | 'tool_calling'   // Executing a tool
  | 'waiting_input'  // Waiting for user input
  | 'error'          // Encountered an error
  | 'stalled';       // No activity for threshold period

interface ActivityStatus {
  agentId: string;
  state: ActivityState;
  since: Date;
  duration: number;  // ms in current state
  lastOutput?: Date;
  lastToolCall?: {
    name: string;
    startedAt: Date;
  };
  healthScore: number;  // 0-100
}
```

### 7.2 Activity Detection (SDK Driver)

For SDK-based agents, activity detection is straightforward via events:

```typescript
class SDKActivityDetector {
  detectState(events: AgentEvent[]): ActivityState {
    const recent = events.slice(-10);

    if (recent.some(e => e.type === 'error')) {
      return 'error';
    }

    if (recent.some(e => e.type === 'tool_call' && !e.completed)) {
      return 'tool_calling';
    }

    const lastOutput = recent.findLast(e => e.type === 'output');
    if (lastOutput && Date.now() - lastOutput.timestamp.getTime() < 5000) {
      return 'working';
    }

    const lastActivity = recent[recent.length - 1];
    if (lastActivity && Date.now() - lastActivity.timestamp.getTime() > 5 * 60 * 1000) {
      return 'stalled';
    }

    return 'idle';
  }
}
```

### 7.3 Checkpoints

Agents can go off-track. Checkpoints allow rolling back to a known-good state.

```typescript
interface Checkpoint {
  id: string;
  agentId: string;
  name?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  createdBy: 'user' | 'auto' | 'agent';
  trigger: 'manual' | 'scheduled' | 'before_risky_op' | 'milestone';

  // Captured state
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  toolState: Record<string, unknown>;
  workingDirectory: string;
  fileSnapshot: FileSnapshot[];  // Modified files since session start
  contextPack?: ContextPack;

  // Metadata
  description?: string;
  tags: string[];
  size: number;  // bytes
  verified: boolean;
  verifiedAt?: Date;

  // Delta chain metadata (for progressive checkpointing)
  checkpointType: 'full' | 'delta';
  parentId?: string;           // For delta checkpoints
  deltaDepth?: number;         // How many deltas to traverse
  fullCheckpointId?: string;   // Nearest full checkpoint in chain
}

interface FileSnapshot {
  path: string;
  content: string;
  hash: string;
  mtime: Date;
}
```

#### 7.3.1 Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing

Instead of full snapshots for each checkpoint, store only what changed since the last checkpoint—dramatically reducing storage costs and restore times.

**The Problem with Full Checkpoints:**

For a 2-hour agent session with 50 modified files, each checkpoint could be 10-50MB. With auto-checkpoints every 30 minutes, that's 4+ checkpoints = 200MB per session. Across many agents and sessions, storage explodes.

**Delta Checkpoint Model:**

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/checkpoint.ts

interface DeltaCheckpoint extends Checkpoint {
  checkpointType: 'delta';
  parentId: string;              // Required for deltas

  // Only what changed since parent
  delta: {
    newConversationTurns: Message[];           // Only new turns
    modifiedToolState: Record<string, unknown>; // Only changed keys
    fileDeltas: FileDelta[];                   // Git-style diffs
  };

  // Chain metadata for fast restore
  chain: {
    depth: number;              // How many checkpoints in chain
    fullCheckpointId: string;   // Nearest full checkpoint
    totalSize: number;          // Sum of chain sizes
  };
}

interface FileDelta {
  path: string;
  type: 'created' | 'modified' | 'deleted';
  diff?: string;                // Unified diff for modifications
  content?: string;             // Full content for created files
  previousHash?: string;        // For verification
}

interface FullCheckpoint extends Checkpoint {
  checkpointType: 'full';
  // Contains complete state (no deltas)
}
```

**Compaction Strategy:**

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/services/checkpoint.service.ts

export class CheckpointService {
  private readonly FULL_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL = 5; // Every 5th is full

  async createCheckpoint(agentId: string, trigger: string): Promise<Checkpoint> {
    const lastCheckpoint = await this.getLastCheckpoint(agentId);
    const deltaDepth = lastCheckpoint?.deltaDepth ?? 0;

    // Create full checkpoint every N checkpoints, or if no parent
    if (!lastCheckpoint || deltaDepth >= this.FULL_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL - 1) {
      return this.createFullCheckpoint(agentId, trigger);
    }

    return this.createDeltaCheckpoint(agentId, lastCheckpoint, trigger);
  }

  private async createDeltaCheckpoint(
    agentId: string,
    parent: Checkpoint,
    trigger: string
  ): Promise<DeltaCheckpoint> {
    const currentState = await this.captureCurrentState(agentId);
    const parentState = await this.loadCheckpointState(parent.id);

    // Compute deltas
    const newTurns = currentState.conversationHistory.slice(
      parentState.conversationHistory.length
    );
    const fileDeltas = await this.computeFileDeltas(
      parentState.fileSnapshot,
      currentState.fileSnapshot
    );
    const toolStateDelta = this.computeObjectDelta(
      parentState.toolState,
      currentState.toolState
    );

    return {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      agentId,
      checkpointType: 'delta',
      parentId: parent.id,
      createdAt: new Date(),
      createdBy: 'auto',
      trigger,
      delta: {
        newConversationTurns: newTurns,
        modifiedToolState: toolStateDelta,
        fileDeltas,
      },
      chain: {
        depth: (parent.deltaDepth ?? 0) + 1,
        fullCheckpointId: parent.fullCheckpointId ?? parent.id,
        totalSize: await this.computeChainSize(parent.id),
      },
      // Metadata
      size: this.computeDeltaSize(newTurns, fileDeltas, toolStateDelta),
      verified: false,
      tags: [],
    };
  }

  async restoreCheckpoint(checkpointId: string): Promise<AgentState> {
    const checkpoint = await this.loadCheckpoint(checkpointId);

    if (checkpoint.checkpointType === 'full') {
      return this.restoreFullCheckpoint(checkpoint);
    }

    // Reconstruct by loading full + applying deltas
    const chain = await this.loadCheckpointChain(checkpointId);
    let state = await this.restoreFullCheckpoint(chain[0] as FullCheckpoint);

    for (let i = 1; i < chain.length; i++) {
      state = this.applyDelta(state, chain[i] as DeltaCheckpoint);
    }

    return state;
  }

  // Background compaction: merge old delta chains into full checkpoints
  async compactOldChains(agentId: string): Promise<void> {
    const checkpoints = await this.listCheckpoints(agentId);
    const oldChains = this.findCompactableChains(checkpoints);

    for (const chain of oldChains) {
      const merged = await this.mergeChainToFull(chain);
      await this.replaceChainWithFull(chain, merged);
    }
  }
}
```

**Storage Comparison:**

| Strategy | Single Checkpoint | 4 Checkpoints/Session | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Full | 25MB | 100MB | Complete state each time |
| Delta | 5MB (full) + 3×2MB (delta) = 11MB | ~55% reduction | Only changes stored |

**Restore Performance:**

| Scenario | Full Checkpoints | Delta Chain |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Latest checkpoint | Load 25MB | Load 11MB, apply 3 patches |
| Typical restore | ~500ms | ~350ms |
| Worst case (deep chain) | Same | Bounded by FULL_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL |

### 7.4 Auto-Checkpoint Triggers

```typescript
const AUTO_CHECKPOINT_TRIGGERS = [
  {
    name: 'before_destructive_tool',
    pattern: /rm|delete|drop|truncate|reset/i,
    description: 'Before potentially destructive operations',
  },
  {
    name: 'milestone',
    interval: 30 * 60 * 1000,  // Every 30 minutes
    description: 'Periodic milestone checkpoints',
  },
  {
    name: 'before_large_change',
    fileCountThreshold: 10,
    description: 'Before modifying many files',
  },
];
```

### 7.5 Token & Context Window Tracking

```typescript
interface TokenUsage {
  agentId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  promptTokens: number;
  completionTokens: number;
  totalTokens: number;
  model: string;
  cost?: number;  // Optional cost estimate
}

interface ContextWindow {
  agentId: string;
  maxTokens: number;
  usedTokens: number;
  remainingTokens: number;
  utilizationPercent: number;
  healthStatus: ContextHealthStatus;
  predictedExhaustionAt?: Date;  // Based on current consumption rate
  preparedSummary?: string;      // Pre-computed for instant swap-in
}

type ContextHealthStatus =
  | 'healthy'    // < 75% utilization
  | 'warning'    // 75-85% - proactive summarization started
  | 'critical'   // 85-95% - auto-compaction in progress
  | 'emergency'; // > 95% - force checkpoint + rotate
```

### 7.6 Auto-Healing Context Window Management

Context window exhaustion is the #1 reliability killer for long-running agents. Rather than reacting after problems occur, the Auto-Healing system **proactively** manages context pressure through graduated interventions.

#### 7.6.1 Health Thresholds & Actions

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/services/context-health.service.ts

interface ContextHealthConfig {
  warningThreshold: 0.75;     // 75% → start preparing summary
  criticalThreshold: 0.85;    // 85% → auto-compact
  emergencyThreshold: 0.95;   // 95% → force checkpoint + rotate

  // Predictive settings
  enablePrediction: boolean;
  predictionWindowMs: number; // Look-ahead window for exhaustion prediction
  consumptionSampleSize: number; // Turns to sample for rate estimation
}

export class ContextHealthService {
  private summaryCache = new Map<string, PreparedSummary>();

  async monitorAgent(agentId: string): Promise<void> {
    const context = await this.getContextWindow(agentId);
    const health = this.assessHealth(context);

    switch (health.status) {
      case 'healthy':
        // No action needed, but start predictive monitoring
        this.updatePrediction(agentId, context);
        break;

      case 'warning':
        // Proactively prepare summary for instant swap-in
        await this.prepareSummary(agentId);
        this.emitEvent('context.warning', { agentId, utilization: context.utilizationPercent });
        break;

      case 'critical':
        // Auto-compact: replace old turns with prepared summary
        await this.autoCompact(agentId);
        this.emitEvent('context.compacted', { agentId, freedTokens: health.freedTokens });
        break;

      case 'emergency':
        // Force checkpoint and rotate to fresh agent
        await this.emergencyRotate(agentId);
        this.emitEvent('context.emergency_rotated', { agentId });
        break;
    }
  }

  private async prepareSummary(agentId: string): Promise<void> {
    if (this.summaryCache.has(agentId)) return;

    const history = await this.getConversationHistory(agentId);
    const oldTurns = history.slice(0, -10); // Keep last 10 turns intact

    // Use a fast model to summarize older turns
    const summary = await this.summarizeService.summarize(oldTurns, {
      maxTokens: 500,
      preserveKeyDecisions: true,
      preserveFileChanges: true,
    });

    this.summaryCache.set(agentId, {
      summary,
      turnsReplaced: oldTurns.length,
      preparedAt: new Date(),
    });
  }

  private async autoCompact(agentId: string): Promise<CompactionResult> {
    const prepared = this.summaryCache.get(agentId);
    if (!prepared) {
      await this.prepareSummary(agentId);
    }

    // Atomically swap old turns for summary
    const result = await this.agentService.replaceHistoryWithSummary(
      agentId,
      prepared.summary,
      prepared.turnsReplaced
    );

    this.summaryCache.delete(agentId);
    return result;
  }

  private async emergencyRotate(agentId: string): Promise<void> {
    // 1. Checkpoint current state
    const checkpoint = await this.checkpointService.create(agentId, {
      trigger: 'emergency_rotation',
      includeFileState: true,
    });

    // 2. Build context pack from checkpoint
    const contextPack = await this.contextService.buildFromCheckpoint(checkpoint);

    // 3. Spawn fresh agent with context pack
    const newAgent = await this.agentService.spawn({
      ...await this.agentService.getConfig(agentId),
      contextPack: contextPack.id,
    });

    // 4. Terminate old agent
    await this.agentService.terminate(agentId, 'context_exhaustion');

    // 5. Notify clients of seamless handover
    this.emitEvent('agent.rotated', {
      oldAgentId: agentId,
      newAgentId: newAgent.id,
      checkpointId: checkpoint.id,
      reason: 'context_exhaustion',
    });
  }
}
```

#### 7.6.2 User Experience

The auto-healing system is designed to be **invisible when working well**:

| Scenario | Without Auto-Healing | With Auto-Healing |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Long task | "Agent crashed: context exceeded" | Agent continues seamlessly |
| Complex refactor | Agent forgets early decisions | Key decisions preserved in summary |
| Multi-hour session | Manual checkpoint + restart | Automatic context refresh |

**UI Indicators:**
- Context utilization bar shows current health status
- "Context refreshed" toast when auto-compaction occurs
- Agent card shows small refresh icon (not disruptive)

#### 7.6.3 WebSocket Events

```typescript
interface ContextHealthEvent {
  type:
    | 'context.healthy'
    | 'context.warning'
    | 'context.compacted'
    | 'context.emergency_rotated';
  data: {
    agentId: string;
    utilization: number;
    healthStatus: ContextHealthStatus;
    action?: string;
    freedTokens?: number;
    newAgentId?: string;
  };
}
```

### 7.7 Agent Rotation & Compaction Strategies

When context windows fill up, agents need rotation:

```typescript
type RotationStrategy =
  | 'summarize_and_continue'  // Summarize history, continue same agent
  | 'fresh_start'             // New agent with context pack
  | 'checkpoint_and_restart'  // Checkpoint, terminate, new agent
  | 'graceful_handoff';       // New agent picks up from summary

interface RotationConfig {
  strategy: RotationStrategy;
  trigger: 'manual' | 'auto';
  threshold?: {
    contextUtilization?: number;  // e.g., 0.9 = 90%
    conversationTurns?: number;
    timeElapsed?: number;  // ms
  };
  preserveContext: boolean;
}
```

### 7.8 First-Class Session Handoff Protocol

When multiple agents work on a project, they often need to hand off work to each other. This requires more than just messaging—it requires a structured transfer of context, state, and resources.

**The Problem Without Structured Handoffs:**
1. Agent A finishes part 1 and updates a bead
2. Human notices
3. Human spawns Agent B
4. Human crafts a prompt explaining the context (often incomplete)

**With the Handoff Protocol:**
1. Agent A initiates handoff: "Hey BlueLake, I've completed the API schema. Your turn for frontend integration."
2. BlueLake automatically receives: task context, relevant conversation history, modified files, and continuation prompt
3. Work continues seamlessly

#### 7.8.1 Handoff Data Model

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/handoff.ts

interface HandoffRequest {
  id: string;
  from: AgentIdentity;
  to: AgentIdentity | 'any';  // 'any' for pool-based assignment

  // What's being handed off
  task: {
    beadId?: string;
    description: string;
    completedWork: string;      // Summary of what was done
    remainingWork: string;      // What the receiver should do
    priority: number;
  };

  // Context transfer
  context: {
    relevantFiles: string[];           // Files the receiver should read
    modifiedFiles: string[];           // Files that were changed
    keyDecisions: string[];            // Important choices made
    conversationSummary: string;       // Condensed history
    openQuestions: string[];           // Unresolved issues
  };

  // Resource transfer
  resources: {
    reservationsToTransfer: string[];  // File reservations to pass
    checkpointId?: string;             // Checkpoint for fallback
    contextPackId?: string;            // Pre-built context pack
  };

  // Handoff metadata
  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'completed' | 'expired';
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
  acceptedAt?: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  rejectionReason?: string;
}

interface HandoffAcceptance {
  handoffId: string;
  agentId: string;
  acknowledgedContext: boolean;
  modifiedRemainingWork?: string;  // Agent can clarify/modify
}
```

#### 7.8.2 Handoff Service

        pattern,
        handoff.from.id,
        acceptingAgentId
      );
    }

    // 2. Load context pack into receiving agent
    const contextPack = await this.contextService.get(handoff.resources.contextPackId);
    await this.agentService.injectContext(acceptingAgentId, contextPack);

    // 3. Update handoff status
    handoff.status = 'accepted';
    handoff.acceptedAt = new Date();
    await this.saveHandoff(handoff);

    // 4. Notify original agent
    await this.mailService.send({

      to: [handoff.from.name],
      subject: `Handoff accepted by ${acceptance.agentId}`,
      body_md: `Your handoff was accepted. ${acceptance.modifiedRemainingWork || ''}`,

#### 7.8.3 WebSocket Events

```typescript
interface HandoffEvent {
  type:
    | 'handoff.initiated'
    | 'handoff.accepted'
    | 'handoff.rejected'
    | 'handoff.completed'
    | 'handoff.expired';
  data: {
    handoff: HandoffRequest;
    acceptingAgent?: string;
    rejectionReason?: string;

## 8. REST API Layer

### 8.1 API Design Philosophy

The REST API follows these principles:

1. **Resource-oriented** — Agents, beads, reservations, messages as resources
2. **Consistent responses** — All responses follow a standard envelope
3. **Idempotent where possible** — PUT/DELETE operations are idempotent
4. **Rich error responses** — Error codes, messages, and actionable hints
5. **AI-agent friendly** — Comprehensive examples for LLM consumption

### 8.2 Base URL Structure

```
Production:  https://api.flywheel.local/v1
Development: http://localhost:8080/api/v1
```

### 8.3 API Conventions

**Content types:**
- Requests: `application/json`
- Responses: `application/json`

**Pagination:**
```
?limit=50&cursor=cursor_01H...
```

**Filtering:**
```
?model=claude&status=working
```

**Sorting:**
```
?sort=-updated_at
```

### 8.4 Idempotency Framework

Agents may retry requests. Without idempotency, this could spawn duplicate agents, send duplicate prompts, or create duplicate checkpoints.

**Idempotency Header:**
For any POST that mutates state, accept:
- `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` header
- Server stores key + result for a TTL window

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts

const idempotencyStore = new Map<string, StoredResult>();

interface StoredResult {
  response: unknown;
  statusCode: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
}

export async function idempotencyMiddleware(c: Context, next: Next) {
  const idempotencyKey = c.req.header('Idempotency-Key');

  if (!idempotencyKey) {
    return next();
  }

  // Check for existing result
  const existing = idempotencyStore.get(idempotencyKey);
  if (existing && existing.expiresAt > new Date()) {
    return c.json(existing.response, existing.statusCode);
  }

  // Execute and store
  await next();

  const response = await c.res.json();
  idempotencyStore.set(idempotencyKey, {
    response,
    statusCode: c.res.status,
    createdAt: new Date(),
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24h TTL
  });
}
```

### 8.4.1 Provisioning API (Queue‑Driven)

Provisioning is a first‑class REST resource. All state changes flow through the queue API.

**Create request:**
```http
POST /provisioning/requests
Idempotency-Key: <uuid>
```

```json
{
  "workspace_id": "workspace-abc123",
  "capacity_profile_id": "profile-standard",
  "provider_id": "provider-a",
  "region": "eu-central",
  "email_verified_at": "2026-01-08T00:00:00Z",
  "onboarding_mode": "manual"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "prov_01HXYZ",
    "state": "pending",
    "created_at": "2026-01-08T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

**Transition request (explicit from/to):**
```http
POST /provisioning/requests/{id}/transition
```
```json
{
  "from": "approved",
  "to": "provisioned",
  "reason": "manual_approval_complete"
}
```

**Allowed transitions:**
- `pending → approved`
- `approved → provisioned`
- `provisioned → verified`
- `verified → assigned`
- Any state → `failed` (with reason)
- `pending/approved` → `expired`
- `failed` → `pending` (retry)

**Preconditions:**
- `pending → approved` requires `email_verified_at`.
- `pending → approved` requires manual approval when `onboarding_mode=manual`.

**Verification report:**
```http
POST /provisioning/requests/{id}/verify
```
```json
{
  "checks": {
    "disk_io": "pass",
    "network_latency_ms": 18,
    "container_health": "pass",
    "monitoring_agent": "pass",
    "caam_ready": "pass"
  },
  "notes": "Initial verification complete"
}
```

**Assignment (BYOA gated):**
```http
POST /provisioning/requests/{id}/assign
```
```json
{
  "requires_byoa": true,
  "min_providers": 1
}
```

If BYOA is not verified, the API returns `BYOA_REQUIRED`.

### 8.5 Error Model & Taxonomy

All errors follow a consistent structure with semantic error codes and HTTP status mappings:

```typescript
interface ApiError {
  error: {
    code: ErrorCode;                    // Semantic error code
    message: string;                    // Human-readable description
    details?: Record<string, unknown>;  // Additional context
    request_id: string;                 // For support/debugging
    hint?: string;                      // Suggested fix for AI agents
    docs_url?: string;                  // Link to relevant documentation
  };
}
```

#### Error Code Taxonomy

Errors are organized into categories with consistent HTTP status mappings:

| Category | Code Pattern | HTTP Status | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Resource** | `*_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource doesn't exist |
| **Resource** | `*_ALREADY_EXISTS` | 409 | Resource already exists |
| **Validation** | `INVALID_*` | 400 | Request validation failed |
| **Validation** | `MISSING_*` | 400 | Required field missing |
| **Auth** | `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Not authenticated |
| **Auth** | `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Not authorized for action |
| **Quota** | `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | 429 | Rate/usage limit hit |
| **Quota** | `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests |
| **State** | `*_IN_PROGRESS` | 409 | Conflicting operation |
| **State** | `*_NOT_READY` | 503 | Resource not ready |
| **Dependency** | `*_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Dependency down |
| **Internal** | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error |

### 8.6 Success Response Envelope

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  request_id: string;
  timestamp: string;        // RFC3339 UTC
  _agent_hints?: {          // For AI agent consumers
    summary: string;
    suggested_actions: Action[];
    warnings: string[];
  };
}
```

### 8.7 Jobs for Long-Running Operations

Some operations take time (building context packs, running scans, exporting checkpoints). These return a job ID immediately, with status polling.

```typescript
interface Job {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  progress?: number;  // 0-100
  createdAt: Date;
  startedAt?: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  result?: unknown;
  error?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}
```

**Jobs REST Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/jobs` | List jobs |
| `GET` | `/jobs/{id}` | Get job status |
| `DELETE` | `/jobs/{id}` | Cancel job |
| `GET` | `/jobs/{id}/result` | Get job result |

**Jobs WebSocket Events:**

```typescript
interface JobEvent {
  type: 'job.started' | 'job.progress' | 'job.completed' | 'job.failed';
  data: {
    jobId: string;
    status: Job['status'];
    progress?: number;
    result?: unknown;
    error?: string;
  };
}
```

### 8.8 OpenAPI & Developer Experience

The API is self-documenting for both humans and AI agents.

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/openapi/generator.ts

import { generateOpenApi } from '@hono/zod-openapi';

export const openApiSpec = generateOpenApi(app, {
  openapi: '3.1.0',
  info: {
    title: 'Flywheel Gateway API',
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: 'Multi-agent orchestration platform API',
  },
  servers: [
    { url: 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1', description: 'Development' },
  ],
});
```

**AI-Agent Hints:**

Every endpoint includes hints for AI consumers:

```typescript
interface EndpointHints {
  summary: string;              // What this does
  whenToUse: string;           // When an agent should call this
  commonMistakes: string[];    // What to avoid
  relatedEndpoints: string[];  // What to call next
  exampleScenarios: string[];  // Real use cases
}
```

**Swagger UI:** Available at `/docs` with interactive testing, request/response examples, authentication helper, and WebSocket documentation.

### 8.10 Golden Path: API Sequence for AI Agents

This section demonstrates the **ideal API call sequence** for an AI agent orchestrating work. Agents consuming the OpenAPI spec should follow this pattern for reliable operation.

#### Scenario: Spawn Agent, Coordinate, Execute Task

```typescript
// Step 1: Check system health and capabilities
const capabilities = await fetch('/api/v1/capabilities').then(r => r.json());
// → Verify required features are available

// Step 2: Check for ready work (if using Beads)
const triage = await fetch('/api/v1/beads/triage').then(r => r.json());
// → Get prioritized recommendations: triage.data.recommendations

// Step 3: Claim work to prevent conflicts
const bead = await fetch('/api/v1/beads/beads-123', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'in_progress', assignee: 'GreenCastle' }),
}).then(r => r.json());

// Step 4: Reserve files before starting work
const reservation = await fetch('/api/v1/reservations', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    paths: ['src/api/users.ts', 'src/api/users.test.ts'],
    agent: 'GreenCastle',
    exclusive: true,
    ttl_seconds: 3600,
  }),
}).then(r => r.json());

// Check for conflicts
if (reservation.data.conflicts.length > 0) {
  // Coordinate via Agent Mail or wait
  console.log('Conflict with:', reservation.data.conflicts[0].holder);
}

// Step 5: Build context pack for the task
const contextPack = await fetch('/api/v1/context/build', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    taskDescription: bead.data.title,
    components: {
      triage: { budget: 2000, enabled: true },
      memory: { budget: 3000, enabled: true },
      cass: { budget: 2000, enabled: true },
    },
  }),
}).then(r => r.json());

// Step 6: Spawn the agent
const agent = await fetch('/api/v1/agents', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'claude',
    workingDir: '/path/to/project',
    contextPack: contextPack.data.id,
  }),
}).then(r => r.json());

// Step 7: Subscribe to output via WebSocket
const ws = new WebSocket('/api/v1/ws');
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  op: 'subscribe',
  topics: [`output:${agent.data.id}`, `agents:${agent.data.id}`],
}));

// Step 8: Send the task prompt
await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}/send`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: `Complete this task: ${bead.data.title}\n\n${bead.data.description}`,
  }),
});

// Step 9: Monitor for completion (via WebSocket events)
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (msg.type === 'agent.state_changed' && msg.data.state === 'idle') {
    // Agent finished
    handleCompletion();
  }
};

// Step 10: On completion, create checkpoint and release resources
async function handleCompletion() {
  // Create checkpoint before cleanup
  await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}/checkpoint`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ reason: 'task_complete' }),
  });

  // Release file reservations
  await fetch('/api/v1/reservations', {
    method: 'DELETE',
    body: JSON.stringify({ agent: 'GreenCastle' }),
  });

  // Close the bead
  await fetch('/api/v1/beads/beads-123/close', { method: 'POST' });

  // Terminate agent (or keep for next task)
  await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });
}
```

#### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
async function safeApiCall<T>(
  url: string,
  options?: RequestInit
): Promise<{ data?: T; error?: ApiError }> {
  const response = await fetch(url, options);

  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json();

    // Handle specific recoverable errors
    switch (error.error.code) {
      case 'QUOTA_EXCEEDED':
        // Rotate to different account and retry
        await fetch('/api/v1/accounts/pools/default/rotate', { method: 'POST' });
        return safeApiCall(url, options);

      case 'RESERVATION_CONFLICT':
        // Wait and retry, or coordinate via mail
        await sleep(30000);
        return safeApiCall(url, options);

      case 'AGENT_BUSY':
        // Wait for agent to finish current operation
        await sleep(5000);
        return safeApiCall(url, options);

      default:
        return { error: error.error };
    }
  }

  return { data: (await response.json()).data };
}
```

#### Key Principles for Agent Consumers

1. **Always check capabilities first** — Don't assume features exist
2. **Reserve before editing** — Prevent file conflicts
3. **Use context packs** — Give agents situational awareness
4. **Subscribe to WebSocket early** — Don't miss events
5. **Create checkpoints** — Enable recovery on failure
6. **Clean up resources** — Release reservations, close beads
7. **Handle errors gracefully** — Many errors are recoverable

```

### 9.2 Connection Endpoint

```
WebSocket URL: wss://api.flywheel.local/v1/ws
              ws://localhost:8080/api/v1/ws (development)

Query Parameters:
  - api_key: Authentication token
```

### 9.3 Subscription Protocol

Client sends:
```json
{
  "op": "subscribe",
  "topics": [
    "events",
    "agents:abc123",
    "output:abc123",
    "notifications",
    "accounts",
    "provisioning"
  ],
  "since": "cursor_01H..."
}
```

Server responds:
```json
{
  "op": "subscribed",
  "topics": ["events", "agents:abc123", "output:abc123", "notifications"],
  "server_time": "2026-01-07T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### 9.4 Event Envelope

```json
{
  "type": "agent.output.append",
  "ts": "2026-01-07T00:00:00.123Z",
  "seq": 184224,
  "topic": "output:abc123",
  "data": {
    "agentId": "abc123",
    "model": "claude",
    "driver": "sdk",
    "chunk": "Analyzing the authentication module...\n",
    "event_type": "text_delta",
    "agent_mail_name": "GreenCastle"
  }
}
```

### 9.5 Event Types

#### Agent Events
- `agent.spawned`
- `agent.state_changed` — idle ↔ working
- `agent.output.append` — New output
- `agent.tool_call` — Tool invocation (SDK/ACP)
- `agent.tool_result` — Tool result
- `agent.error`
- `agent.terminated`

#### Beads Events
- `bead.created`
- `bead.updated`
- `bead.closed`
- `bead.claimed`

#### Mail Events
- `mail.received`
- `mail.read`
- `mail.acknowledged`

#### Reservation Events
- `reservation.granted`
- `reservation.released`
- `reservation.conflict`

#### Scanner Events
- `scanner.started`
- `scanner.finding`
- `scanner.complete`

#### System Events
- `alert.created`
- `approval.requested`
- `approval.resolved`

### 9.6 Reconnection & Resume

Network interruptions happen. Clients need to automatically reconnect and resume without missing events.

**Cursor-Based Resume:**

```typescript
// Client sends on reconnect
{
  "op": "subscribe",
  "topics": ["agents:abc123", "output:abc123"],
  "since": {
    "cursor": "cursor_01H...",
    // OR
    "seq": 185000
  }
}

// Server responds
{
  "op": "subscribed",
  "resumedFrom": "cursor_01H...",
  "missedEvents": 42,  // How many events were buffered
  "bufferOverflow": false  // If true, some events were lost
}
```

**Snapshot-on-Connect (when buffer overflow):**

```typescript
// Server sends
{
  "type": "stream.reset",
  "topic": "output:abc123",
  "data": {
    "reason": "cursor_expired",
    "snapshot": {
      "lines": ["...last 200 lines..."],
      "currentSeq": 186000
    }
  }
}
```

**Client Implementation:**

```typescript
// apps/web/src/lib/ws.ts

export class ReconnectingWebSocket {
  private ws: WebSocket | null = null;
  private lastSeq = new Map<string, number>();
  private reconnectAttempts = 0;
  private maxReconnectAttempts = 10;
  private reconnectDelay = 1000;

  connect() {
    this.ws = new WebSocket(this.url);

    this.ws.onopen = () => {
      this.reconnectAttempts = 0;
      this.resubscribe();
    };

    this.ws.onclose = () => {
      this.scheduleReconnect();
    };

    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
      if (msg.seq) {
        this.lastSeq.set(msg.topic, msg.seq);
      }
      this.emit('message', msg);
    };
  }

  private resubscribe() {
    for (const [topic, seq] of this.lastSeq) {
      this.send({
        op: 'subscribe',
        topics: [topic],
        since: { seq },
      });
    }
  }

  private scheduleReconnect() {
    if (this.reconnectAttempts >= this.maxReconnectAttempts) {
      this.emit('maxReconnectAttemptsReached');
      return;
    }

    const delay = this.reconnectDelay * Math.pow(2, this.reconnectAttempts);
    this.reconnectAttempts++;

    setTimeout(() => this.connect(), delay);
  }
}
```

### 9.7 Backpressure & Performance

For high-throughput agents, output can exceed what a browser can render.

**Server-side:**
- Per-agent ring buffer (configurable, default 10000 lines)
- Per-client subscription limits

**Client options:**
```json
{
  "op": "subscribe",
  "topics": ["output:abc123"],
  "options": {
    "mode": "lines",       // "lines" (safe) or "raw" (fast)
    "throttle_ms": 100,    // Batch updates
    "max_lines_per_msg": 50
  }
}
```

### 9.8 Reliability & Acknowledgment Protocol

For mission-critical events (approvals, conflicts, errors), the WebSocket layer provides guaranteed delivery with acknowledgments.

#### Sequence Numbers & Resume

Every event has a monotonically increasing sequence number per topic:

```typescript
interface ReliableEvent {
  seq: number;           // Monotonic per topic
  ts: string;            // ISO-8601 timestamp
  topic: string;
  type: string;
  data: unknown;
  requires_ack?: boolean; // Client must acknowledge
}
```

**Resume from last seen:**

```json
{
  "op": "subscribe",
  "topics": ["alerts", "approvals"],
  "since": { "alerts": 1234, "approvals": 567 }
}
```

The server replays any events with `seq > since[topic]` before streaming live events.

#### Acknowledgment Protocol

Critical events (marked with `requires_ack: true`) must be acknowledged:

```typescript
// Server sends critical event
{
  "seq": 1235,
  "topic": "approvals",
  "type": "approval.requested",
  "requires_ack": true,
  "ack_deadline_ms": 30000,
  "data": {
    "approval_id": "apr_123",
    "action": "git push --force",
    "risk_level": "dangerous"
  }
}

// Client must respond within deadline
{
  "op": "ack",
  "topic": "approvals",
  "seq": 1235
}
```

If not acknowledged within deadline, the server:
1. Logs a delivery failure
2. Retries delivery up to 3 times
3. Falls back to alternative notification (email, webhook)

#### Missed Message Detection

Clients detect gaps in sequence numbers:

```typescript
class ReliableWebSocket {
  private lastSeq = new Map<string, number>();

  handleMessage(event: ReliableEvent) {
    const lastSeen = this.lastSeq.get(event.topic) ?? 0;

    if (event.seq > lastSeen + 1) {
      // Gap detected - request replay
      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        op: 'replay',
        topic: event.topic,
        from_seq: lastSeen + 1,
        to_seq: event.seq - 1,
      }));
    }

    this.lastSeq.set(event.topic, event.seq);
    this.processEvent(event);
  }
}
```

### 9.9 Scale-Out Architecture

For high-availability deployments with multiple gateway instances, WebSocket connections are distributed across servers with shared state.

#### Redis Adapter Pattern

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/ws/redis-adapter.ts

import { Redis } from 'ioredis';

interface ScaleOutConfig {
  mode: 'single' | 'redis' | 'cluster';
  redis?: {
    url: string;
    keyPrefix: string;
  };
}

export class RedisWebSocketAdapter {
  private pub: Redis;
  private sub: Redis;

  constructor(private config: ScaleOutConfig) {
    if (config.mode === 'redis') {
      this.pub = new Redis(config.redis!.url);
      this.sub = new Redis(config.redis!.url);
      this.setupSubscriptions();
    }
  }

  // Broadcast to all servers
  async broadcast(topic: string, event: WebSocketEvent): Promise<void> {
    if (this.config.mode === 'single') {
      // Direct broadcast to local connections
      this.localHub.broadcast(topic, event);
    } else {
      // Publish to Redis, all servers receive and broadcast locally
      await this.pub.publish(
        `${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:${topic}`,
        JSON.stringify(event)
      );
    }
  }

  private setupSubscriptions() {
    this.sub.psubscribe(`${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:*`);

    this.sub.on('pmessage', (pattern, channel, message) => {
      const topic = channel.replace(`${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:`, '');
      const event = JSON.parse(message);
      this.localHub.broadcast(topic, event);
    });
  }
}
```

#### Sticky Sessions

For WebSocket connections, use sticky sessions to route reconnecting clients to the same server:

```typescript
// Connection ID encodes server affinity
interface ConnectionId {
  serverId: string;    // e.g., 'gateway-1'
  connectionId: string; // UUID
  createdAt: number;
}

// Load balancer uses X-Server-Id header for routing
function generateConnectionId(serverId: string): string {
  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({
    serverId,
    connectionId: crypto.randomUUID(),
    createdAt: Date.now(),
  })).toString('base64url');
}
```

#### Horizontal Scaling Topology

**Scaling Guidelines:**

| Metric | Single Server | Redis Mode | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| Connections | ~10,000 | ~100,000+ | Per gateway instance |
| Events/sec | ~50,000 | ~500,000 | Aggregate across cluster |
| Latency | <10ms | <50ms | Pub/sub adds overhead |
| Complexity | Low | Medium | Redis operational burden |

**Recommendation:** Start with single-server mode. Add Redis only when:
- You need >10,000 concurrent WebSocket connections
- You require zero-downtime deployments
- You need geographic distribution

## 10. Context Pack Building Engine

### 10.1 The "Brain" of the Flywheel

Context packs are pre-assembled prompts that give agents situational awareness. They combine:
- **Triage data** (from BV) — What work is ready, blocked, recommended
- **Memory** (from CM) — Relevant rules, anti-patterns, past solutions
- **Search results** (from CASS) — Similar past sessions
- **Session context** (from S2P) — Recent conversation history

### 10.2 Token Budget Allocation

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/context.ts

interface ContextPackConfig {
  totalBudget: number;  // Total tokens available
  components: {
    triage: { budget: number; enabled: boolean };
    memory: { budget: number; enabled: boolean };
    cass: { budget: number; enabled: boolean };
    s2p: { budget: number; enabled: boolean };
  };
  agentType: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';
  taskDescription: string;
}

interface ContextPack {
  id: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  config: ContextPackConfig;
  sections: {
    triage?: string;
    memory?: string;
    cass?: string;
    s2p?: string;
  };
  tokenCounts: {
    triage: number;
    memory: number;
    cass: number;
    s2p: number;
    total: number;
  };
  renderedPrompt: string;
}
```

### 10.3 Context Builder Service

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/services/context.service.ts

export class ContextService {
  constructor(
    private bvClient: BVClient,
    private cmClient: CMClient,
    private cassClient: CASSClient,
  ) {}

  async buildPack(config: ContextPackConfig): Promise<ContextPack> {
    const [triage, memory, cass] = await Promise.all([
      config.components.triage.enabled
        ? this.buildTriageSection(config)
        : null,
      config.components.memory.enabled
        ? this.buildMemorySection(config)
        : null,
      config.components.cass.enabled
        ? this.buildCassSection(config)
        : null,
    ]);

    // Render according to agent type
    const renderedPrompt = this.renderForAgent(
      config.agentType,
      { triage, memory, cass }
    );

    return {
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      createdAt: new Date(),
      config,
      sections: { triage, memory, cass },
      tokenCounts: this.countTokens({ triage, memory, cass }),
      renderedPrompt,
    };
  }

  private async buildTriageSection(config: ContextPackConfig): Promise<string> {
    const triage = await this.bvClient.getTriage();

    // Prioritize: recommendations > quick_wins > blockers
    const sections = [
      this.formatRecommendations(triage.recommendations, config.components.triage.budget * 0.5),
      this.formatQuickWins(triage.quick_wins, config.components.triage.budget * 0.3),
      this.formatBlockers(triage.blockers_to_clear, config.components.triage.budget * 0.2),
    ];

    return sections.filter(Boolean).join('\n\n');
  }

  private renderForAgent(
    agentType: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini',
    sections: Record<string, string | null>
  ): string {
    // Different agents have different optimal prompt formats
    switch (agentType) {
      case 'claude':
        return this.renderClaudeFormat(sections);
      case 'codex':
        return this.renderCodexFormat(sections);
      case 'gemini':
        return this.renderGeminiFormat(sections);
    }
  }
}
```

### 10.4 REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/context/build` | Build context pack |
| `GET` | `/context/{id}` | Get built pack |
| `GET` | `/context/preview` | Preview without persisting |
| `GET` | `/context/stats` | Usage statistics |
| `DELETE` | `/context/cache` | Clear cache |

## 12. Conflict Detection & Resolution

### 12.1 What Causes Conflicts

When multiple agents work on the same codebase:
- Overlapping file edits
- Competing git branches
- Incompatible changes to shared modules
- Race conditions in file reservations

### 12.2 Conflict Detection Service

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/services/conflict.service.ts

interface FileConflict {
  path: string;

    agentId: string;
    agentName: string;
    operation: 'read' | 'write' | 'delete';
    timestamp: Date;
  }>;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  suggestedResolution?: string;
}

export class ConflictService {
  private fileWatcher: FSWatcher;
  private recentOperations = new Map<string, FileOperation[]>();

  async detectConflicts(): Promise<FileConflict[]> {
    const conflicts: FileConflict[] = [];

    for (const [path, operations] of this.recentOperations) {
      const writers = operations.filter(op => op.operation !== 'read');
      if (writers.length > 1) {
        conflicts.push({
          path,
          agents: writers.map(op => ({

          suggestedResolution: this.suggestResolution(path, writers),
        });
      }
    }

    conflictId: string,
    resolution: 'keep_first' | 'keep_last' | 'merge' | 'manual'
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### 12.3 REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/conflicts` | List active conflicts |
| `GET` | `/conflicts/{id}` | Get conflict details |
| `POST` | `/conflicts/{id}/resolve` | Resolve conflict |

### 12.4 WebSocket Events

```typescript
interface ConflictEvent {
  type: 'conflict.detected' | 'conflict.resolved' | 'conflict.escalated';
  data: FileConflict;
}
```

### 12.5 Conflict Heatmap Component

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/conflicts/ConflictHeatmap.tsx

### 12.6 Intelligent Conflict Resolution Assistant

When conflicts occur, simply reporting "conflict with BlueLake" isn't enough—users need actionable guidance. The Intelligent Conflict Resolution Assistant uses AI-powered analysis to suggest resolutions based on task context, agent progress, and historical patterns.

#### 12.6.1 Resolution Strategy Types

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/conflict-resolution.ts

type ConflictStrategy =
  | 'wait'              // Agent can wait; holder almost done
  | 'split'             // File can be partitioned (different functions/sections)
  | 'sequence'          // Tasks have natural ordering; requeue
  | 'transfer'          // Holder should yield; lower priority task
  | 'merge_tasks'       // Tasks are complementary; combine
  | 'coordinate'        // Agents should coordinate via mail
  | 'escalate';         // Requires human decision

interface ConflictResolutionSuggestion {
  conflict: FileConflict;
  suggestions: Array<{
    strategy: ConflictStrategy;
    confidence: number;           // 0-1, how confident the system is
    rationale: string;            // Human-readable explanation
    estimatedWaitTime?: number;   // For 'wait' strategy (ms)
    actions: ConflictAction[];    // Actionable steps
    requiresUserApproval: boolean;

## 16. CAAM Account & Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)

CAAM (Coding Agent Account Manager) is the **account/profile orchestration layer** for Flywheel Gateway. It is designed for **BYOA (Bring Your Own Account)** subscription logins by default, with optional **BYOK (API key)** support for advanced automation use cases.

**Non‑negotiable security invariant:** OAuth credentials are never stored in Gateway’s central database. All auth artifacts live inside each workspace’s isolated environment, managed by CAAM. Gateway only stores **non‑sensitive metadata** (presence, hashes, timestamps, health).

### 16.1 Principles

1. **BYOA first** — subscription accounts (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) are the default path.
2. **No credential custody** — Gateway never sees Google/Anthropic/OpenAI logins or passwords.
3. **Tenant‑local auth artifacts** — tokens remain inside the workspace container/volume.
4. **Minimum requirement** — at least one verified provider to activate/assign; recommended: 1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro.
5. **Provider parity** — Claude, Codex, and Gemini are all supported.
6. **Autonomous rotation** — cooldown + rotation is automated via CAAM.

### 16.2 Account & Profile Data Model

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/accounts.ts

type ProviderId = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';
type AuthMode = 'oauth_browser' | 'device_code' | 'api_key';

interface AccountProfile {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  provider: ProviderId;
  name: string;               // Profile label (e.g., "work", "alice@gmail.com")
  authMode: AuthMode;

  // Status & health (no secrets)
  status: 'unlinked' | 'linked' | 'verified' | 'expired' | 'cooldown' | 'error';
  statusMessage?: string;
  lastVerifiedAt?: Date;
  expiresAt?: Date;           // If known from token metadata
  cooldownUntil?: Date;
  lastUsedAt?: Date;
  healthScore?: number;       // 0..100

  // Auth artifacts (metadata only)
  artifacts: {
    authFilesPresent: boolean;
    authFileHash?: string;    // hash of auth artifact for change detection
    storageMode?: 'file' | 'keyring' | 'unknown';
  };

  labels?: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface AccountPool {
  id: string;
  workspaceId: string;
  provider: ProviderId;
  profileIds: string[];
  rotationStrategy: 'smart' | 'round_robin' | 'least_recent' | 'random';
  cooldownMinutesDefault: number;
  maxRetries: number;
}

interface TenantAuthState {
  workspaceId: string;
  byoaStatus: 'unlinked' | 'pending' | 'verified' | 'failed';
  verifiedProviders: ProviderId[];
  lastCheckedAt?: Date;
}
```

### 16.3 CAAM Integration Architecture

CAAM runs **inside each workspace container**. Gateway interacts with it via a thin runner interface:

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/caam/runner.ts

interface LoginChallenge {
  provider: ProviderId;
  mode: 'device_code' | 'oauth_url' | 'local_browser' | 'manual_copy';
  code?: string;              // For device code
  verificationUrl?: string;   // For device code
  loginUrl?: string;          // For browser OAuth
  instructions?: string;      // Human-readable fallback
  expiresInSeconds?: number;
}

interface CaamRunner {
  listProfiles(workspaceId: string): Promise<AccountProfile[]>;
  getStatus(workspaceId: string, provider?: ProviderId): Promise<TenantAuthState>;
  startLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId, mode?: AuthMode): Promise<LoginChallenge>;
  completeLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId): Promise<{ status: 'linked' | 'failed' }>;
  activateProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string): Promise<void>;
  runWithProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, command: string[]): Promise<ExecResult>;
  setCooldown(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, minutes: number, reason?: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Notes:**
- CAAM is the source of truth for auth artifacts.
- Gateway records only metadata (status, hashes, timestamps).
- Rotation happens at runtime by selecting the healthiest profile.
- Runner implementation should wrap the `caam` CLI from `/data/projects/coding_agent_account_manager` and keep auth paths aligned with `caam paths` output.

### 16.4 Provider Auth Flows (BYOA)

**Generic BYOA linking flow:**
1. Gateway calls CAAM `startLogin` for the workspace/provider.
2. UI displays device code or OAuth URL to the user.
3. User completes auth on their own machine.
4. CAAM detects new auth artifacts locally and marks profile `verified`.
5. Gateway pulls metadata only (status, hashes, timestamps).

**Codex (GPT Pro)**
- Standard login: `codex login` (local browser flow).
- Device code login: `codex login --device-auth` (headless-friendly).
- Auth cache stored in `~/.codex/auth.json` by default or OS credential store; set `cli_auth_credentials_store=file` for CAAM.
- CAAM uses `CODEX_HOME` to isolate profiles per agent.

**Claude Code (Claude Max)**
- Login is initiated in CLI via `/login`.
- Credentials are stored locally by the CLI; file locations can change between releases.
- CAAM detects the **actual** auth artifacts and records hashes.

**Gemini CLI**
- Settings live in `~/.gemini/settings.json` or project `.gemini/settings.json`.
- Auth modes: Google login, API key, or Vertex AI; `/auth` switches the method.
- Headless containers use API key or Vertex AI (browserless).

**BYOK reference (pi-mono):**
- API key mode uses environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Gateway should map workspace secrets into these env vars when BYOK is enabled.

#### 16.4.1 Auth Artifact Discovery & Normalization

CAAM does **not** hardcode auth file paths as the source of truth. It discovers and normalizes artifacts at runtime and stores **metadata only** (hash + timestamps) in Gateway.

| Provider | Typical Auth Artifacts (Tenant‑local) | Isolation Anchor | Notes |
|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Codex** | `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) | `HOME`, `CODEX_HOME` | CLI can use OS credential store; CAAM forces file mode inside workspace. |
| **Claude** | `~/.claude.json`, `~/.config/claude-code/auth.json` | `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Files may change by release; CAAM tracks actual writes. |
| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/settings.json` (or project `.gemini/settings.json`) | `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | OAuth or API key mode; settings location is stable. |

**Normalization rules:**
- Track only hashes + modified timestamps (never contents).
- If multiple artifacts exist, prefer the most recently modified set.
- Any auth artifact change invalidates prior health score until re‑verified.

#### 16.4.2 Login Modes (Provider‑Aware)

**Device Code (Codex):**
- CAAM starts device auth and returns a verification URL + code.
- UI shows code, button to open URL, and progress indicator.

**Browser OAuth (Codex default, Gemini):**
- CAAM emits a login URL detected from CLI output.
- User opens URL on their own machine and completes login.

**Slash Command (Claude Code):**
- User runs `/login` in the CLI; CAAM waits for new auth artifacts.

**Manual Copy (Codex fallback):**
- User logs in on their own machine.
- Copy `~/.codex/auth.json` into the workspace via a secure upload path.
- CAAM records the hash and marks the profile verified (no cookies stored centrally).

Example response:

```json
{
  "provider": "codex",
  "mode": "device_code",
  "code": "B7QZ-4NJD",
  "verificationUrl": "https://example.com/activate",
  "expiresInSeconds": 900
}
```

#### 16.4.3 BYOA Verification Rules

Verification is **local, artifact‑based**, and avoids network calls by default:

1. Auth artifacts exist and are readable inside the workspace container.
2. CAAM reports `status=verified` for at least one provider.
3. Optional (configurable): passive expiry parsing from token metadata.
4. Optional (configurable): active validation via minimal CLI call (off by default).

#### 16.4.4 Auth Storage Modes & Keyring Policy

Some CLIs can store credentials in a system keyring. This is **not** suitable for workspace‑isolated automation.

**Policy:**
- Enforce file‑based storage inside workspace containers.
- For Codex CLI, set `cli_auth_credentials_store=file` in `~/.codex/config.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME`).
- If keyring storage is detected, CAAM switches to file mode (provider‑specific).
- Gateway stores `storageMode` metadata for visibility.

#### 16.4.5 Account Multiplicity Guidance

Minimum: **1 provider verified**.  
Recommended for steady throughput: **1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro**.  
Scale‑up guidance: add additional accounts per provider as concurrency grows (rotation handles rate limits automatically).

### 16.5 REST API Endpoints (BYOA‑aware)

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/accounts/byoa-status` | Tenant BYOA readiness (verified providers, status) |
| `GET` | `/accounts/profiles` | List CAAM profiles (metadata only) |
| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/start` | Start OAuth or device‑code flow |
| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/complete` | Confirm login completion |
| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/activate` | Activate profile for next agent run |
| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/cooldown` | Cooldown profile (rate‑limit hit) |
| `POST` | `/accounts/pools/{id}/rotate` | Force rotation to next profile |

### 16.6 Rotation & Rate Limit Handling

Rotation is driven by CAAM health scores and cooldown timers. When a rate‑limit signature is detected in agent output, the system:

1. Marks the current profile in cooldown.
2. Selects the next healthiest profile from the pool.
3. Replays the command (when safe).

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/caam/rotation.ts

async function handleRateLimit(ctx: RotationContext): Promise<void> {
  await caam.setCooldown(ctx.workspaceId, ctx.profileId, ctx.cooldownMinutes, 'rate_limit');
  const next = await caam.selectNext(ctx.workspaceId, ctx.provider);
  await caam.activateProfile(ctx.workspaceId, next.id);
}
```

### 16.7 Account Management UI

The UI prioritizes **BYOA readiness**:
- Provider cards show number of verified profiles + cooldown status
- One‑click “Link Account” flows (device code or OAuth URL)
- Health indicators and recommended profile for each provider
- Clear warnings when BYOA is insufficient for assignment

### 16.8 BYOA UX Flow (Detailed)

**Onboarding sequence:**
1. User signs up and verifies email.
2. Provisioning request is created (queue).
3. Manual onboarding approval when `onboarding_mode=manual`.
4. Tenant container is provisioned + verified.
5. UI forces **Link Accounts** step (BYOA gate).
6. At least one provider verified → workspace assigned.

**Link Account flow (device code):**
- User selects provider → UI shows verification URL + device code.
- User opens URL on their own machine, enters code, approves.
- UI polls status until CAAM marks profile verified.

**Link Account flow (OAuth URL):**
- UI displays login URL captured from CLI output.
- User opens URL on their own machine, completes login.
- CAAM detects new auth artifacts → profile verified.

**Failure modes:**
- Expired code → UI offers “Restart login”.
- Rate‑limit hit → CAAM cooldown + next profile selection.
- Artifact drift → CAAM marks profile `unlinked`, UI prompts relink.

**UI state model:**

```
NEEDS_ACCOUNTS → LINKING → VERIFIED
      ↘──────── ERROR ─────↗
```

**Provider card content:**
- Status badge: `UNLINKED | LINKING | VERIFIED | COOLDOWN | EXPIRED`
- Primary action: `Link Account`, `Relink`, or `Rotate`
- Secondary actions: `Copy code`, `Open URL`, `Troubleshoot`
- Health hints: “Last verified 2h ago”, “Cooldown 43m remaining”

**Copy & UX details:**
- Device code is shown with a **copy** button and a countdown timer.
- OAuth URL is shown with a **one‑click open** button (opens in new tab).
- “I completed login” button triggers an immediate CAAM recheck.

**UX guardrails:**
- No dismissing the BYOA gate until minimum provider count is met.
- Warning banner recommends adding **Claude Max + GPT Pro** for stability.

## 21. Metrics & Alert System

Comprehensive monitoring with configurable alerts for proactive issue detection. Prometheus remains the **authoritative** source for real-time alerting and SLOs; ClickHouse is used for long-term analytics and historical aggregation (audit, usage, and event logs).

### 21.1 Metrics Data Model

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/metrics.ts

interface MetricSnapshot {
  timestamp: Date;

  // Agent metrics
  agents: {
    total: number;
    byStatus: Record<string, number>;
    byType: Record<string, number>;
  };

  // Token usage
  tokens: {
    last24h: number;
    last7d: number;
    last30d: number;
    byModel: Record<string, number>;
    trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable';
    trendPercent: number;
  };

  // Performance
  performance: {
    avgResponseMs: number;
    p50ResponseMs: number;
    p95ResponseMs: number;
    p99ResponseMs: number;
    successRate: number;
  };

  // Flywheel metrics
  flywheel: {
    beadsOpen: number;
    beadsClosed24h: number;
    conflictsDetected: number;
    conflictsResolved: number;
    reservationsActive: number;
    messagesExchanged24h: number;
  };

  // System metrics
  system: {
    wsConnections: number;
    apiLatencyMs: number;
    daemonsHealthy: number;
    daemonsTotal: number;
    memoryUsageMb: number;
    cpuPercent: number;
  };
}
```

### 21.2 Alert Configuration

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/alerts.ts

  condition: (context: AlertContext) => boolean;
  severity: AlertSeverity;
  title: string | ((context: AlertContext) => string);
  message: string | ((context: AlertContext) => string);
  cooldown?: number;  // Minimum time between alerts
  actions?: AlertAction[];
}

const DEFAULT_ALERT_RULES: AlertRule[] = [
  {
    name: 'agent_stalled',
    enabled: true,
    condition: (ctx) => {
      const lastActivity = ctx.agent?.lastActivityAt;

    condition: (ctx) => {
      const usage = ctx.account?.quotaUsed ?? 0;
      const limit = ctx.account?.quotaLimit ?? Infinity;
      return usage / limit > 0.8;
    },
    severity: 'warning',
    title: 'Quota Warning',
    message: (ctx) => `Account ${ctx.account?.name} is at ${Math.round((ctx.account!.quotaUsed / ctx.account!.quotaLimit!) * 100)}% quota`,
    actions: [
      { label: 'Rotate Account', action: 'rotate_account' },
    ],
  },
  {
    name: 'daemon_failed',
    enabled: true,
    condition: (ctx) => ctx.daemon?.status === 'failed',
    severity: 'critical',
    title: 'Daemon Failed',
    message: (ctx) => `Daemon ${ctx.daemon?.name} has failed: ${ctx.daemon?.lastError}`,
    actions: [
      { label: 'Restart', action: 'restart_daemon' },
      { label: 'View Logs', action: 'view_daemon_logs' },
    ],
  },
];

### 21.9 Comprehensive Notification System

A multi-channel notification system with intelligent routing, preferences, and actionable alerts.

#### 21.9.1 Notification Data Model

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/notifications.ts

interface Notification {
  id: string;
  type: NotificationType;
  category: 'agents' | 'coordination' | 'tasks' | 'costs' | 'system';
  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  title: string;
  body: string;
  recipientId: string;
  source: { type: 'agent' | 'system' | 'bead' | 'conflict'; id?: string; name?: string };
  actions?: Array<{ id: string; label: string; style: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'; action: string }>;
  link?: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'sent' | 'delivered' | 'read' | 'actioned';
  channels: ('in_app' | 'email' | 'slack' | 'webhook')[];
  createdAt: Date;
  readAt?: Date;
}

type NotificationType =
  | 'agent.started' | 'agent.completed' | 'agent.failed' | 'agent.stalled' | 'agent.needs_approval'
  | 'conflict.detected' | 'conflict.resolved' | 'handoff.requested' | 'handoff.accepted'
  | 'bead.assigned' | 'bead.completed' | 'bead.blocked'
  | 'cost.budget_warning' | 'cost.budget_exceeded'
  | 'system.daemon_failed' | 'digest.daily' | 'digest.weekly';

interface NotificationPreferences {
  userId: string;
  enabled: boolean;

  quietHours?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    start: string;          // "22:00"
    end: string;            // "08:00"
    allowUrgent: boolean;
  };

  categories: Record<string, {
    enabled: boolean;
    channels: ('in_app' | 'email' | 'slack' | 'webhook')[];

    frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly';
    timeOfDay: string;
  };

  channels: {
    email?: { address: string; verified: boolean };
    slack?: { workspaceId: string; channelId: string };
    webhook?: { url: string; secret: string };

}
```

#### 21.9.2 Notification Service

```typescript

  lg: '1.5rem',
  xl: '2rem',
  '2xl': '3rem',

#### CSS Custom Properties

The design system uses CSS custom properties for runtime theming:

```css
/* apps/web/src/styles/theme.css */

:root {
  /* Surface colors (dark theme default) */
  --surface-0: #0f172a;    /* Deepest background (body) */
  --surface-1: #1e293b;    /* Cards, panels */
  --surface-2: #334155;    /* Elevated elements */
  --surface-3: #475569;    /* Borders, dividers */

  /* Text hierarchy */
  --text-primary: #f8fafc;
  --text-secondary: #94a3b8;
  --text-tertiary: #64748b;
  --text-muted: #475569;

  /* Semantic colors */
  --accent: #0ea5e9;
  --accent-hover: #0284c7;
  --success: #22c55e;
  --warning: #f59e0b;
  --error: #ef4444;
  --info: #3b82f6;

  /* Agent identity colors */
  --agent-claude: #d97706;
  --agent-codex: #16a34a;
  --agent-gemini: #2563eb;

  /* Status indicators */
  --status-idle: #64748b;
  --status-working: #22c55e;
  --status-thinking: #f59e0b;
  --status-error: #ef4444;
  --status-stalled: #8b5cf6;

  /* Spacing scale */
  --space-1: 0.25rem;
  --space-2: 0.5rem;
  --space-3: 0.75rem;
  --space-4: 1rem;
  --space-6: 1.5rem;
  --space-8: 2rem;
  --space-12: 3rem;

  /* Animation */
  --transition-fast: 150ms ease;
  --transition-base: 200ms ease;
  --transition-slow: 300ms ease;

  /* Shadows */
  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.05);
  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.3);
  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.4);
  --shadow-glow: 0 0 20px rgb(14 165 233 / 0.3);
}
```

#### Tailwind CSS Configuration

```typescript
// apps/web/tailwind.config.ts

import type { Config } from 'tailwindcss';

export default {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        surface: {
          0: 'var(--surface-0)',
          1: 'var(--surface-1)',
          2: 'var(--surface-2)',
          3: 'var(--surface-3)',
        },
        agent: {
          claude: 'var(--agent-claude)',
          codex: 'var(--agent-codex)',
          gemini: 'var(--agent-gemini)',
        },
        status: {
          idle: 'var(--status-idle)',
          working: 'var(--status-working)',
          thinking: 'var(--status-thinking)',
          error: 'var(--status-error)',
          stalled: 'var(--status-stalled)',
        },
      },
      fontFamily: {
        sans: ['Inter var', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'],
        mono: ['JetBrains Mono', 'Fira Code', 'monospace'],
      },
      animation: {
        'pulse-slow': 'pulse 3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.6, 1) infinite',
        'spin-slow': 'spin 2s linear infinite',
        'bounce-subtle': 'bounce 2s ease-in-out infinite',
      },
      boxShadow: {
        'glow': 'var(--shadow-glow)',
        'glow-error': '0 0 20px rgb(239 68 68 / 0.3)',
        'glow-success': '0 0 20px rgb(34 197 94 / 0.3)',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
  ],
} satisfies Config;
```

#### Design Principles

1. **Dark-first**: Designed for dark environments (developers, ops)
2. **High contrast**: WCAG AA minimum for all text
3. **Semantic colors**: Status and severity encoded in color
4. **Agent identity**: Consistent visual language per agent type
5. **Motion with purpose**: Animations indicate state, not decoration
6. **Information density**: Optimize for at-a-glance comprehension

### 22.2 Core Component Library

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx

import { cva, type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority';

const buttonVariants = cva(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700',
        destructive: 'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700',
        outline: 'border border-slate-700 bg-transparent hover:bg-slate-800',
        ghost: 'hover:bg-slate-800 text-slate-400 hover:text-white',
        link: 'text-blue-400 underline-offset-4 hover:underline',
      },
      size: {
        sm: 'h-8 px-3 text-sm',
        md: 'h-10 px-4',
        lg: 'h-12 px-6 text-lg',
        icon: 'h-10 w-10',
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'default',
      size: 'md',
    },
  }
);

export interface ButtonProps
  extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>,
    VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {
  loading?: boolean;
}

export function Button({
  className,
  variant,
  size,
  loading,
  children,
  disabled,
  ...props
}: ButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button
      className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size }), className)}
      disabled={disabled || loading}
      {...props}
    >
      {loading && <LoaderIcon className="w-4 h-4 mr-2 animate-spin" />}
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### 22.3 Application Shell

During Phase 1, the UI should run in a deterministic mock-data mode (fixtures + simulated WS events) so navigation, layouts, and information architecture can ship before all endpoints exist. As registry-backed APIs land, swap mocks to real queries one surface at a time.

```tsx
// apps/web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx

export function AppShell({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100">
      {/* Desktop Sidebar */}
      {!isMobile && <DesktopSidebar />}

      {/* Main Content */}
      <main
        className={cn(
          'min-h-screen',
          !isMobile && 'ml-64'  // Sidebar width
        )}
      >
        {/* Top Bar */}
        <TopBar />

        {/* Page Content */}
        <div className="p-6">
          {children}
        </div>
      </main>

      {/* Mobile Navigation */}
      {isMobile && <MobileNavigation />}

      {/* Global Modals */}
      <ModalProvider />

      {/* Toast Notifications */}
      <Toaster position="bottom-right" />

      {/* Command Palette */}
      <CommandPalette />
    </div>
  );
}

function DesktopSidebar() {

### 22.4 Real-Time Agent Collaboration Graph

The Agent Collaboration Graph is an interactive, real-time visualization that shows exactly how agents are coordinating—who's talking to whom, which files are reserved by which agent, where dependency bottlenecks exist, and how work flows through the system.

**Why this matters:** The entire value proposition of Flywheel Gateway is multi-agent coordination. Yet coordination is inherently invisible. When three agents are working on a project, users need to answer questions like:
- "Why is BlueLake waiting?"
- "Who has src/api.ts reserved?"
- "Are GreenCastle and RedStone going to conflict?"

The Collaboration Graph makes the invisible visible.

#### 22.4.1 Graph Data Model

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/collaboration-graph.ts

interface CollaborationGraph {
  nodes: AgentNode[];
  edges: CollaborationEdge[];
  reservations: ReservationNode[];
  conflicts: ConflictNode[];
  handoffs: HandoffEdge[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

interface AgentNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'agent';
  data: {
    agentId: string;
    agentName: string;
    agentType: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';
    status: 'idle' | 'working' | 'thinking' | 'waiting' | 'error';
    currentTask?: string;
    contextHealth: ContextHealthStatus;
    lastActivity: Date;
  };
  position: { x: number; y: number };
}

interface CollaborationEdge {
  id: string;
  type: 'message' | 'handoff' | 'dependency';
  source: string;  // Agent ID
  target: string;  // Agent ID
  data: {
    messageCount?: number;
    lastMessageAt?: Date;
    handoffStatus?: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'completed';
    animated: boolean;
  };
}

interface ReservationNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'reservation';
  data: {
    pattern: string;
    holderId: string;
    holderName: string;
    exclusive: boolean;
    expiresAt: Date;
    ttlPercent: number;
  };
  position: { x: number; y: number };
}

interface ConflictNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'conflict';
  data: {
    conflictId: string;
    path: string;
    agents: string[];
    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    suggestedStrategy?: ConflictStrategy;
  };

#### 22.4.4 REST Endpoints for Collaboration Graph

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/collaboration/graph` | Full graph state |
| `GET` | `/collaboration/graph/agents` | Agent-only view |
| `GET` | `/collaboration/graph/files` | File reservation view |
| `GET` | `/collaboration/graph/stats` | Graph statistics |
| `GET` | `/collaboration/graph/history` | Historical snapshots |

#### 22.4.5 WebSocket Topics

```typescript
// Real-time graph update topics
const GRAPH_TOPICS = [
  'agents:*',          // Agent status changes
  'reservations',      // File reservation changes
  'conflicts',         // Conflict detection/resolution
  'handoffs',          // Handoff initiation/completion
  'mail',              // Message exchanges (for edge animation)
  'context.health',    // Context window health changes
];
```

### 22.5 Performance Budgets

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Agent list interaction** | < 100ms | Time from click to visual feedback |
| **Output stream scroll** | 60fps | Frame rate during scrolling |
| **WebSocket message processing** | < 16ms | Time to process and render |
| **Initial load (desktop)** | < 2s | First Contentful Paint |
| **Initial load (mobile)** | < 3s | First Contentful Paint |
| **Time to Interactive** | < 3.5s | TTI metric |
| **Bundle size (JS)** | < 200kb | Gzipped initial bundle |

## 23. Desktop vs Mobile UX Strategy

### 23.1 Responsive Design Principles

```typescript

## 24. Security & Audit

### 24.1 Audit Log Schema

```typescript
// packages/shared/src/types/audit.ts

interface AuditEntry {
  id: string;
  correlationId: string;
  timestamp: Date;

  // Identity
  userId?: string;
  apiKeyId?: string;
  agentId?: string;
  clientIp: string;
  userAgent: string;

  // Request
  method: string;
  path: string;
  params: Record<string, unknown>;
  body?: unknown;  // Sensitive fields redacted

  // Response
  statusCode: number;
  responseTime: number;
  error?: string;

  // Context
  resourceType?: string;
  resourceId?: string;
  action: AuditAction;
  tags: string[];
}

type AuditAction =
  | 'agent.spawn'
  | 'agent.terminate'
  | 'agent.send'
  | 'agent.interrupt'
  | 'authz.allow'
  | 'authz.deny'
  | 'policy.update'
  | 'role.assign'
  | 'role.revoke'
  | 'checkpoint.create'
  | 'checkpoint.restore'
  | 'account.create'
  | 'account.update'
  | 'account.delete'
  | 'safety.violation'
  | 'safety.approval'
  | 'file.create'
  | 'file.update'
  | 'file.delete'
  | 'git.commit'
  | 'git.push';
```

### 24.2 Audit Service

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/services/audit.service.ts

export class AuditService {
  private readonly SENSITIVE_FIELDS = [
    'apiKey',
    'password',
    'token',
    'secret',
    'authorization',
  ];

  async log(entry: Omit<AuditEntry, 'id' | 'timestamp'>): Promise<void> {
    const sanitized = this.sanitize(entry);

    await this.db.insert(auditLogs).values({
      ...sanitized,
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

    // Emit for real-time monitoring
    this.events.emit('audit.entry', sanitized);

    // Forward to ClickHouse for long-term analytics (append-only)
    await this.analytics.writeAudit(sanitized);
  }

  private sanitize(entry: Partial<AuditEntry>): Partial<AuditEntry> {
    const sanitized = { ...entry };

    if (sanitized.body) {
      sanitized.body = this.redactSensitive(sanitized.body);
    }

    if (sanitized.params) {
      sanitized.params = this.redactSensitive(sanitized.params);
    }

    return sanitized;
  }

  private redactSensitive(obj: unknown): unknown {
    if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) {
      return obj;
    }

    if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
      return obj.map(item => this.redactSensitive(item));
    }

    const result: Record<string, unknown> = {};
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
      if (this.SENSITIVE_FIELDS.some(field =>
        key.toLowerCase().includes(field.toLowerCase())
      )) {
        result[key] = '[REDACTED]';
      } else {
        result[key] = this.redactSensitive(value);
      }
    }

    return result;
  }

  async query(filters: AuditQueryFilters): Promise<AuditEntry[]> {
    let query = this.db.select().from(auditLogs);

    if (filters.userId) {
      query = query.where(eq(auditLogs.userId, filters.userId));
    }
    if (filters.action) {
      query = query.where(eq(auditLogs.action, filters.action));
    }
    if (filters.since) {
      query = query.where(gte(auditLogs.timestamp, filters.since));
    }
    if (filters.until) {
      query = query.where(lte(auditLogs.timestamp, filters.until));
    }

    return query
      .orderBy(desc(auditLogs.timestamp))
      .limit(filters.limit ?? 100)
      .offset(filters.offset ?? 0);
  }
}
```

Audit entries are stored in the primary database for operational queries and also forwarded to ClickHouse for long-term analytics. Usage events follow the same analytics sink so cost/usage reporting can run on ClickHouse without impacting the OLTP path.

### 24.3 Audit REST Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/audit` | Query audit log |
| `GET` | `/audit/{correlationId}` | Get request trace |
| `POST` | `/audit/export` | Export audit data |
| `GET` | `/audit/stats` | Audit statistics |

Authz decisions, policy changes, and role assignments are always audited and exported for long-term retention in ClickHouse.

### 24.4 Security Headers Middleware

```typescript
// apps/gateway/src/middleware/security.ts

export function securityHeaders(): MiddlewareHandler {
  return async (c, next) => {
    await next();

    // Security headers
    c.header('X-Content-Type-Options', 'nosniff');
    c.header('X-Frame-Options', 'DENY');
    c.header('X-XSS-Protection', '1; mode=block');
    c.header('Referrer-Policy', 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin');
    c.header(
      'Content-Security-Policy',
      "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' wss:"
    );

    // Remove server identification
    c.header('Server', 'Flywheel');
  };
}
```

### 25.7 Parity Gate Tests

Parity Gate tests ensure the Command Registry (§4.4) stays consistent. These run in CI and fail the build on violations.

#### CI Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/parity-gate.yml

name: Parity Gate

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'packages/shared/src/commands/**'
      - 'apps/gateway/src/openapi/**'
      - 'apps/gateway/src/routes/**'

jobs:
  parity-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

      - name: Run parity gate tests
        run: bun test scripts/parity-gate.test.ts

      - name: Verify OpenAPI spec is up-to-date
        run: |
          bun run generate:openapi
          git diff --exit-code apps/gateway/src/openapi/spec.json
```

This ensures that:
- Every command is API-accessible (no hidden CLI features)
- Every endpoint is documented (no undocumented APIs)
- Every error is documented (no surprise failures)
- Types stay in sync (no runtime type mismatches)

## 30. Reference Architecture

See `/reference/ntm/` for reference implementations from the NTM project:

- `agentmail/` — MCP client patterns
- `bv/` — BV integration patterns
- `robot/` — JSON schema patterns for structured responses
- `pipeline/` — Pipeline execution model
- `context/` — Context pack building algorithms

When implementing features, consult these references for patterns and data structures, but implement in idiomatic TypeScript/Bun.
