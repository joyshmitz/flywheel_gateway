/**
 * @flywheel/agent-drivers - Agent Driver Abstraction Layer
 *
 * This package provides a unified interface for multiple agent execution backends:
 * - SDK Driver: Direct API calls to Claude/Codex/Gemini SDKs (primary)
 * - ACP Driver: Agent Client Protocol for IDE-compatible structured events
 * - NTM Driver: Named Tmux Manager for multi-agent orchestration
 * - Tmux Driver: Visual terminal access for power users
 * - Mock Driver: Testing and development
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * import { selectDriver, DriverRequirements } from "@flywheel/agent-drivers";
 *
 * // Auto-select best available driver
 * const { driver, type, reason } = await selectDriver({
 *   preferredType: "sdk",
 *   requiredCapabilities: ["streaming", "interrupt"],
 * });
 *
 * // Spawn an agent
 * const { agent } = await driver.spawn({
 *   id: "agent-123",
 *   provider: "claude",
 *   model: "claude-opus-4",
 *   workingDirectory: "/path/to/workspace",
 * });
 *
 * // Subscribe to events
 * for await (const event of driver.subscribe(agent.id)) {
 *   console.log(event.type, event);
 * }
 * ```
