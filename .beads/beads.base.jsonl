{"id":"flywheel_gateway-0wr","title":"Mobile Optimization","description":"## Background\n\nMobile users represent a significant and growing portion of web traffic. The Flywheel Gateway dashboard must provide a first-class mobile experience to enable administrators and developers to monitor and manage their AI agent infrastructure from any device. This includes responsive layouts, touch-optimized interactions, and mobile-specific navigation patterns.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nModern dashboards often neglect mobile experiences, forcing users to pinch-zoom and struggle with tiny touch targets. By implementing mobile optimization from the ground up, we ensure:\n\n1. **Accessibility**: Users can manage their agents on-the-go\n2. **Emergency Response**: Critical alerts can be addressed from mobile devices\n3. **Professional Quality**: Demonstrates attention to detail and user experience\n4. **Quality Bar**: Many dashboards have poor mobile support; we aim for a first-class experience\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/styles/breakpoints.ts\nexport const BREAKPOINTS = {\n  xs: 320,   // Small phones\n  sm: 480,   // Large phones\n  md: 768,   // Tablets portrait\n  lg: 1024,  // Tablets landscape / small laptops\n  xl: 1280,  // Desktops\n  xxl: 1536  // Large screens\n} as const;\n\nexport const mediaQueries = {\n  mobile: `(max-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.md - 1}px)`,\n  tablet: `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.md}px) and (max-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.lg - 1}px)`,\n  desktop: `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.lg}px)`\n};\n```\n\n### Touch Target Guidelines\n- Minimum touch target: 44x44px (Apple HIG recommendation)\n- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (8px minimum)\n- Visual feedback on touch (active states, ripple effects)\n\n### Mobile Navigation Architecture\n```typescript\n// Bottom tab bar navigation for mobile\ninterface MobileNavItem {\n  icon: React.ComponentType;\n  label: string;\n  path: string;\n  badge?: number; // For notifications\n}\n\nconst mobileNavItems: MobileNavItem[] = [\n  { icon: HomeIcon, label: 'Dashboard', path: '/' },\n  { icon: AgentsIcon, label: 'Agents', path: '/agents' },\n  { icon: TerminalIcon, label: 'Sessions', path: '/sessions' },\n  { icon: SettingsIcon, label: 'Settings', path: '/settings' }\n];\n```\n\n### Gesture Support Implementation\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/hooks/useMobileGestures.ts\ninterface GestureConfig {\n  onSwipeLeft?: () =\u003e void;\n  onSwipeRight?: () =\u003e void;\n  onSwipeUp?: () =\u003e void;\n  onSwipeDown?: () =\u003e void;\n  onPullToRefresh?: () =\u003e Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  swipeThreshold?: number; // Default: 50px\n  pullThreshold?: number;  // Default: 80px\n}\n\nexport function useMobileGestures(config: GestureConfig): {\n  handlers: {\n    onTouchStart: TouchEventHandler;\n    onTouchMove: TouchEventHandler;\n    onTouchEnd: TouchEventHandler;\n  };\n  isRefreshing: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n### Mobile-Optimized Agent Cards\n- Collapsible details to save vertical space\n- Swipe actions (archive, restart, view details)\n- Compact status indicators\n- Touch-friendly action buttons\n\n### Safe Area Handling\n```css\n/* Handle notch and home indicator on modern phones */\n.mobile-container {\n  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);\n  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);\n  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);\n  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);\n}\n\n.bottom-nav {\n  padding-bottom: max(16px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Components\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileLayout.tsx` - Main mobile layout wrapper\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/BottomTabBar.tsx` - Bottom navigation\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileAgentCard.tsx` - Touch-optimized agent cards\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/PullToRefresh.tsx` - Pull-to-refresh component\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeableListItem.tsx` - Swipeable list items\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileHeader.tsx` - Mobile-specific header\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileDrawer.tsx` - Slide-out drawer menu\n\n### Hooks\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useMobileGestures.ts` - Gesture detection hook\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts` - Responsive breakpoint detection\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useSwipeActions.ts` - Swipe action management\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useSafeArea.ts` - Safe area inset detection\n\n### Styles\n- `apps/web/src/styles/breakpoints.ts` - Breakpoint constants\n- `apps/web/src/styles/mobile.css` - Mobile-specific styles\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Responsive Design\n- [ ] All pages render correctly at 320px width (minimum supported)\n- [ ] Smooth transitions between breakpoints\n- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile devices\n- [ ] Text remains readable without zooming\n\n### Touch Targets\n- [ ] All interactive elements are at least 44x44px\n- [ ] Adequate spacing prevents accidental taps\n- [ ] Visual feedback on all touch interactions\n- [ ] No hover-only interactions\n\n### Navigation\n- [ ] Bottom tab bar visible on mobile viewports\n- [ ] Current route clearly indicated\n- [ ] Badge counts display for notifications\n- [ ] Smooth page transitions\n\n### Gestures\n- [ ] Swipe left/right on agent cards for quick actions\n- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works on list views\n- [ ] Gestures don't interfere with scrolling\n- [ ] Gesture hints for discoverability\n\n### Agent Cards\n- [ ] Compact view shows essential information\n- [ ] Tap to expand for full details\n- [ ] Swipe actions work smoothly\n- [ ] Status changes animate appropriately\n\n### Safe Areas\n- [ ] Content not obscured by notch\n- [ ] Bottom nav above home indicator\n- [ ] Landscape orientation handled correctly\n- [ ] Works on iOS and Android browsers\n\n### Performance\n- [ ] 60fps animations and transitions\n- [ ] Touch response under 100ms\n- [ ] No jank during gestures\n- [ ] Efficient re-renders during interaction\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Test on real devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)\n- Test with browser dev tools device emulation\n- Verify touch targets with accessibility tools\n- Test gesture interactions with touch simulation\n- Visual regression tests for each breakpoint\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Gesture hooks: swipe/pull-to-refresh state machine and threshold handling\n- [ ] Responsive breakpoints + safe-area handling helpers\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Mobile navigation renders correct routes and preserves state across refresh\n- [ ] Touch target sizing and focus management are validated in component tests\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Mobile viewport (e.g., iPhone 13): navigate core routes without horizontal scroll\n- [ ] Pull-to-refresh on list views triggers refetch and shows loading state\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] E2E tests log viewport/device profile + route transitions;

This pattern ensures API parity across all surfaces and eliminates the possibility of drift between implementations.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\n### Why Command Registry?\n\nTraditional API development often leads to drift between different API surfaces:\n- REST endpoints may accept different parameters than tRPC procedures\n- WebSocket events may have different payload shapes than HTTP responses\n- Client SDKs may fall out of sync with server implementations\n- OpenAPI specs may not reflect actual behavior\n\nThe Command Registry pattern solves this by:\n1. **Single Definition**: Each command is defined once with full type information\n2. **Generated Surfaces**: All API surfaces are generated from command definitions\n3. **Compile-Time Safety**: Type mismatches are caught at build time, not runtime\n4. **Automatic Parity**: Changes to a command automatically propagate to all surfaces\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Command Definition Schema (Zod-based)\n\nEach command is defined using a Zod schema that captures:\n- **name**: Unique command identifier (e.g., `agent.spawn`, `checkpoint.create`)\n- **input**: Zod schema for input validation\n- **output**: Zod schema for output validation\n- **metadata**: Permissions, rate limits, audit requirements\n- **aiHints**: Structured hints for AI-assisted usage\n\n```typescript\nconst spawnAgentCommand = defineCommand({\n  name: 'agent.spawn',\n  input: z.object({\n    repoUrl: z.string().url(),\n    task: z.string(),\n    model: z.enum(['opus-4', 'sonnet-4']).default('sonnet-4'),\n  }),\n  output: z.object({\n    agentId: z.string().uuid(),\n    status: z.enum(['spawning', 'running', 'idle']),\n  }),\n  metadata: {\n    permissions: ['agent:write'],\n    rateLimit: { requests: 10, window: '1m' },\n    audit: true,\n  },\n  aiHints: {\n    whenToUse: 'Use when starting a new agent to work on a task',\n    examples: ['Spawn an agent to fix the login bug', 'Create an agent for the new feature'],\n    relatedCommands: ['agent.stop', 'agent.status'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Registration Mechanism\n\nCommands are registered in a central registry that:\n1. Validates command definitions at startup\n2. Detects naming conflicts\n3. Builds lookup indexes for runtime dispatch\n4. Triggers codegen when definitions change\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/commands/registry.ts\nexport const commandRegistry = createCommandRegistry([\n  agentCommands,\n  checkpointCommands,\n  accountCommands,\n  // ... other command groups\n]);\n```\n\n### Codegen Targets\n\nThe codegen system produces the following outputs:\n\n| Target | Output Location | Description |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| REST Routes | `apps/gateway/src/routes/generated/` | Hono route handlers with validation |\n| tRPC Procedures | `apps/gateway/src/trpc/generated/` | Type-safe tRPC router |\n| OpenAPI Spec | `apps/gateway/openapi.json` | Full OpenAPI 3.1 specification |\n| WebSocket Schemas | `apps/gateway/src/ws/generated/` | Event type definitions |\n| TypeScript Client | `packages/client/src/generated/` | Fully typed SDK |\n\n### AI Hints Structure\n\nThe `aiHints` field provides structured guidance for AI-assisted usage:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AIHints {\n  /** When this command should be used */\n  whenToUse: string;\n  /** Example natural language requests that map to this command */\n  examples: string[];\n  /** Related commands the AI should consider */\n  relatedCommands: string[];\n  /** Common mistakes to avoid */\n  pitfalls?: string[];\n  /** Prerequisites that must be met */\n  prerequisites?: string[];\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n```\npackages/shared/src/commands/\n├── registry.ts          # Central command registry\n├── define.ts            # defineCommand helper\n├── types.ts             # Command type definitions\n├── codegen/\n│   ├── rest.ts          # REST route generator\n│   ├── trpc.ts          # tRPC procedure generator\n│   ├── openapi.ts       # OpenAPI spec generator\n│   ├── websocket.ts     # WebSocket schema generator\n│   └── client.ts        # TypeScript client generator\n└── commands/\n    ├── agent.ts         # Agent-related commands\n    ├── checkpoint.ts    # Checkpoint commands\n    ├── account.ts       # Account commands\n    └── index.ts         # Command group exports\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n\n- [ ] Command schema validation tests\n  - Valid command definitions are accepted\n  - Invalid definitions throw descriptive errors\n  - Zod schema compilation works correctly\n- [ ] Each codegen target has dedicated tests\n  - REST generator produces valid Hono routes\n  - tRPC generator produces valid procedures\n  - OpenAPI generator produces valid spec\n  - WebSocket generator produces valid schemas\n  - Client generator produces compilable TypeScript\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n- [ ] Parity tests verify all surfaces accept identical inputs\n- [ ] Parity tests verify all surfaces return identical outputs\n- [ ] Round-trip tests: client -\u003e server -\u003e client type safety\n- [ ] Cross-surface tests: REST and tRPC produce identical results\n\n### Parity Gate Tests\n\nReference: flywheel_gateway-3tp (Parity Gate) implements automated parity verification that runs in CI. The Command Registry codegen must produce outputs that pass these gates.\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Codegen/parity tests log command name + generated REST path/method + schema bindings for fast diagnosis\n- [ ] Snapshot/fixture diffs include a minimal, readable diff (and never leak secrets in generated examples)\n\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\n### Structured Logging for Codegen\n\n```typescript\nlogger.info('codegen:start', {\n  target: 'rest',\n  commandCount: 42,\n  outputPath: 'apps/gateway/src/routes/generated/',\n});\n\nlogger.info('codegen:complete', {\n  target: 'rest',\n  filesGenerated: 12,\n  durationMs: 156,\n});\n```\n\n### Error Reporting\n\n```typescript\nlogger.error('codegen:invalid-command', {\n  commandName: 'agent.spawn',\n  error: 'Input schema references undefined type',\n  location: 'packages/shared/src/commands/agent.ts:42',\n});\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Command Registry accepts valid command definitions\n- [ ] Registry rejects invalid definitions with helpful errors\n- [ ] REST codegen produces working Hono routes\n- [ ] tRPC codegen produces working procedures\n- [ ] OpenAPI codegen produces valid 3.1 spec\n- [ ] WebSocket codegen produces type definitions\n- [ ] Client codegen produces compilable TypeScript SDK\n- [ ] All generated surfaces pass parity tests\n- [ ] AI hints are included in generated documentation\n- [ ] Codegen runs complete in \u003c5 seconds\n- [ ] Changes to commands trigger regeneration in watch mode\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md §4.4 - Command Registry Architecture\n- flywheel_gateway-3tp - Parity Gate (consumes codegen outputs)\n","notes":"## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] defineCommand: returns valid CommandDefinition\n- [ ] defineCommand: validates required fields\n- [ ] CommandRegistry: registers command by name\n- [ ] CommandRegistry: retrieves command by name\n- [ ] CommandRegistry: lists all commands by category\n- [ ] REST binding: method and path are required\n- [ ] REST binding: pathParams parsed from path template\n- [ ] WebSocket binding: emitsEvents is array\n- [ ] AI hints: whenToUse is non-empty string\n- [ ] AI hints: commonMistakes is array\n- [ ] Zod schema: inputSchema validates correctly\n- [ ] Zod schema: outputSchema validates correctly\n- [ ] Codegen: generates Hono routes from registry\n- [ ] Codegen: generates tRPC procedures from registry\n- [ ] Codegen: generates OpenAPI spec from registry\n- [ ] Codegen: generates TypeScript client from registry\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Generated routes match REST binding paths\n- [ ] Generated routes apply Zod validation\n- [ ] Generated OpenAPI includes all commands\n- [ ] Generated OpenAPI includes AI hints as x-ai-hints\n- [ ] Generated OpenAPI examples are valid\n- [ ] Generated client calls correct endpoints\n- [ ] Command handler receives validated input\n- [ ] Command handler output matches schema\n\n### Parity Gate Tests\n- [ ] Every command has REST binding\n- [ ] Every command has AI hints\n- [ ] DELETE commands not marked as 'safe'\n- [ ] Long-running commands return jobId\n- [ ] All commands have examples\n- [ ] OpenAPI spec validates against JSON Schema\n- [ ] No duplicate command names\n- [ ] No conflicting REST paths\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] API call through generated client succeeds\n- [ ] Error from generated client matches schema\n- [ ] Streaming endpoint works through client\n\n### Build Tests\n- [ ] Codegen runs without errors\n- [ ] Generated files compile without errors\n- [ ] Parity check passes in CI","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T13:29:26.480233251-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T19:04:24.828132928-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T19:04:24.828132928-05:00","close_reason":"Core implementation complete: Command Registry with defineCommand, validation, 7 agent commands, and 5 codegen targets (REST, tRPC, OpenAPI, WebSocket, TypeScript Client). 34 tests passing.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-350","title":"Idempotency Middleware","description":"## Background\n\nIn distributed systems, network failures, client retries, and load balancer timeouts can cause duplicate requests. Without idempotency protection, these duplicates can result in:\n- Duplicate agent invocations (wasted tokens/cost)\n- Inconsistent state (e.g., double-creating resources)\n- Race conditions between concurrent identical requests\n- Poor user experience with unexpected behavior\n\nThe Flywheel Gateway needs robust idempotency middleware to ensure that retrying a request produces the same result as the original, without re-executing the underlying operation.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Idempotency Key Strategy\n\nClients include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique identifier (typically UUID v4). The middleware:\n\n1. **On first request**: Execute handler, cache response with key\n2. **On duplicate request**: Return cached response without re-execution\n3. **On concurrent duplicate**: Block until first completes, return same result\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts\ninterface IdempotencyRecord {\n  key: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  \n  // Request fingerprint\n  method: string;\n  path: string;\n  bodyHash: string;\n  \n  // Response cache\n  statusCode: number;\n  headers: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n  body: string;\n  \n  // State\n  status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';\n  \n  // Timing\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n  completedAt?: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Request Fingerprinting\n\nTo detect mismatched requests using the same key:\n- Hash the request body (SHA-256)\n- Compare method and path\n- Return 422 if key reused with different request\n\n### Concurrency Handling\n\nWhen a duplicate request arrives while the original is processing:\n\n```typescript\nasync function handleConcurrentRequest(key: string): Promise\u003cResponse\u003e {\n  const maxWaitMs = 30000;  // 30 second timeout\n  const pollIntervalMs = 100;\n  \n  for (let elapsed = 0; elapsed \u003c maxWaitMs; elapsed += pollIntervalMs) {\n    const record = await getIdempotencyRecord(key);\n    \n    if (record.status === 'completed') {\n      return reconstructResponse(record);\n    }\n    \n    if (record.status === 'failed') {\n      // Allow retry on failure\n      return null;  \n    }\n    \n    await sleep(pollIntervalMs);\n  }\n  \n  throw new GatewayTimeoutError('Original request still processing');\n}\n```\n\n### TTL Configuration\n\nIdempotency records have configurable time-to-live:\n- Default: 24 hours\n- Minimum: 1 hour  \n- Maximum: 7 days\n- Configurable per-workspace via settings\n\nAfter TTL expiration, the same key can be reused for a new request.\n\n### Storage Backend\n\nOptions for idempotency record storage:\n1. **Redis** (preferred): Fast, built-in TTL, atomic operations\n2. **PostgreSQL**: Fallback if Redis unavailable, requires cleanup job\n3. **Memory**: Development only, not suitable for multi-instance\n\n```typescript\ninterface IdempotencyStore {\n  get(key: string): Promise\u003cIdempotencyRecord | null\u003e;\n  set(key: string, record: IdempotencyRecord): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  setIfNotExists(key: string, record: IdempotencyRecord): Promise\u003cboolean\u003e;\n  update(key: string, updates: Partial\u003cIdempotencyRecord\u003e): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  delete(key: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Scope of Protection\n\nIdempotency middleware applies to mutating endpoints:\n- POST requests (all)\n- PUT requests (all)\n- PATCH requests (all)\n- DELETE requests (configurable)\n\nGET and HEAD requests are naturally idempotent and excluded.\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Core Implementation\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts` - Main middleware\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.store.ts` - Storage abstraction\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.redis.ts` - Redis implementation\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.postgres.ts` - PostgreSQL fallback\n- `apps/gateway/src/types/idempotency.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces\n\n### Configuration\n- `apps/gateway/src/config/idempotency.config.ts` - TTL and behavior settings\n\n### Tests\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/__tests__/idempotency.test.ts`\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/__tests__/idempotency.integration.test.ts`\n\n## API Behavior\n\n### Headers\n\nRequest:\n```\nPOST /api/agents/invoke\nIdempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\n```\n\nResponse (first request):\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nIdempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\nIdempotency-Replayed: false\n```\n\nResponse (duplicate request):\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nIdempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\nIdempotency-Replayed: true\n```\n\n### Error Cases\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity\n{\n  \"error\": \"idempotency_mismatch\",\n  \"message\": \"Idempotency key already used with different request parameters\"\n}\n\nHTTP/1.1 409 Conflict  \n{\n  \"error\": \"idempotency_conflict\",\n  \"message\": \"Request with this idempotency key is currently processing\"\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. [ ] Middleware intercepts all POST/PUT/PATCH requests\n2. [ ] Idempotency-Key header is parsed and validated (UUID format)\n3. [ ] First request executes normally and caches response\n4. [ ] Duplicate request returns cached response without re-execution\n5. [ ] Idempotency-Replayed header indicates whether response was cached\n6. [ ] Request fingerprinting detects mismatched key reuse (422 error)\n7. [ ] Concurrent duplicates block until original completes\n8. [ ] TTL is configurable per-workspace (1h to 7d range)\n9. [ ] Expired records are automatically cleaned up\n10. [ ] Redis storage works with automatic TTL expiration\n11. [ ] PostgreSQL fallback works when Redis unavailable\n12. [ ] Failed requests allow retry with same key\n13. [ ] Streaming responses are handled correctly (cache final state)\n14. [ ] Performance overhead is minimal (\u003c5ms for cache check)\n15. [ ] multi-workspace isolation (keys scoped to workspace)\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **Large response bodies**: Compress before caching, max 10MB\n- **Streaming responses**: Buffer complete response before caching\n- **Request timeout**: Mark as failed, allow retry\n- **Server restart**: Redis persistence preserves records\n- **Clock skew**: Use Redis server time for TTL\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Redis connection (primary storage)\n- PostgreSQL (fallback storage)\n- Request body parsing middleware\n- workspace authentication middleware\n\n## Reference\n\nPLAN.md §8 - Idempotency and Request Deduplication\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Idempotency key parsing + normalization (header + body variants)\n- [ ] Request fingerprinting (method/path/body hash) prevents cross-endpoint replay\n- [ ] Storage adapter: TTL expiry, overwrite rules, and concurrent access behavior\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Repeat the same mutating request with same idempotency key → no duplicate side effects and identical response\n- [ ] Same idempotency key with different request fingerprint → 409/4xx with actionable error code\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Storage unavailable → safe fallback (configurable) with clear error + no partial writes\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + idempotencyKeyHash (never raw key) + replay=true/false\n\n","notes":"## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] IdempotencyKey: parses from header\n- [ ] IdempotencyKey: generates if missing (optional)\n- [ ] IdempotencyKey: validates format\n- [ ] Cache: stores response by key\n- [ ] Cache: retrieves cached response\n- [ ] Cache: expires after TTL\n- [ ] Middleware: checks cache first\n- [ ] Middleware: executes if miss\n- [ ] Middleware: stores after execution\n- [ ] Middleware: returns cached on hit\n- [ ] Conflict: detects in-flight duplicate\n- [ ] Conflict: waits for original to complete\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Duplicate request returns same response\n- [ ] Different key executes independently\n- [ ] In-flight duplicate waits\n- [ ] Expired key re-executes\n- [ ] Error response not cached\n- [ ] Success response cached\n- [ ] All mutating endpoints covered\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Double-click submit safe\n- [ ] Network retry returns same result\n- [ ] Concurrent requests handled\n\n### Performance Tests\n- [ ] Cache lookup \u003c1ms\n- [ ] Cache store \u003c5ms\n- [ ] Minimal latency overhead\n- [ ] High concurrency stable\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Cache unavailable: pass-through\n- [ ] Invalid key format: 400 error\n- [ ] Key collision: detected\n- [ ] Timeout waiting: error returned","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T13:37:54.340641515-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-08T20:49:14.77231621-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-350","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T14:01:56.644788491-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

Client sends HTTP request\n2. Authentication middleware validates token\n3. Route handler receives request\n4. Service layer executes business logic\n5. Database operations performed\n6. Response returned to client\n7. WebSocket events broadcast if applicable\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Bun + Hono?\n- **Performance**: Bun's native HTTP server is 3-4x faster than Node.js\n- **Simplicity**: Hono provides Express-like DX with better types\n- **WebSockets**: Bun has native WebSocket support\n\n### Why SQLite for Development?\n- Zero configuration required\n- File-based, easy to reset\n- Sufficient for single-node deployments\n- PostgreSQL for production scaling\n\n### WebSocket Architecture\n[Diagram: WebSocket message flow]\n\n- Room-based subscription model\n- Server-initiated heartbeats\n- Automatic reconnection with backoff\n- Message acknowledgment for critical events\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md Enhancement\n\n```markdown\n# AGENTS.md\n\n# AI Agent Instructions for Flywheel Gateway\n\n## Project Overview\nFlywheel Gateway is a real-time dashboard for managing AI agents built with:\n- **Runtime**: Bun\n- **Backend**: Hono (TypeScript)\n- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS\n- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL\n- **Testing**: Bun test, Playwright\n\n## Codebase Conventions\n\n### File Organization\n- Feature-based structure in `apps/web/src/`\n- Shared types in `packages/shared/`\n- Tests co-located or in `tests/` directory\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Components: PascalCase (`AgentCard.tsx`)\n- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAgentStatus.ts`)\n- Utils: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- Types: PascalCase with `T` or descriptive suffix (`AgentStatus`, `ApiResponse`)\n\n### Code Style\n- Prefer `const` over `let`\n- Use explicit return types on exported functions\n- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` with type guards\n- Use template literals for string interpolation\n\n### Component Patterns\n```typescript\n// Preferred: Functional components with explicit props\ninterface AgentCardProps {\n  agent: Agent;\n  onSelect?: (id: string) =\u003e void;\n}\n\nexport function AgentCard({ agent, onSelect }: AgentCardProps) {\n  return (/* ... */);\n}\n```\n\n### State Management\n- Local state: `useState`\n- Server state: React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)\n- Global state: Zustand (minimal use)\n\n### API Patterns\n- Use Hono's typed routes\n- Validate with Zod schemas\n- Return consistent error format\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Unit tests for utilities and hooks\n- Integration tests for API routes\n- E2E tests for critical paths\n- Aim for 80% coverage on new code\n\n### Logging\n- Tests and doc validation output include doc path + failing section and are secret-safe (no tokens/keys)\n- E2E failures capture screenshots/traces when UI docs/examples are exercised\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Adding a New API Endpoint\n1. Define Zod schema in `packages/shared/src/schemas/`\n2. Add route handler in `apps/gateway/src/routes/`\n3. Update OpenAPI spec in `docs/openapi.yaml`\n4.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-36m","title":"Checkpoint/Restore System with Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing","description":"## Background\n\nThe Checkpoint/Restore System is a critical infrastructure component that enables session state persistence and recovery. This feature addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining continuity in long-running agent sessions, where context can be lost due to crashes, timeouts, or intentional session transfers.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Session Resilience**: Agent sessions can run for extended periods. Without checkpointing, any interruption means losing all accumulated context and progress.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency**: Re-running prompts to reconstruct state is expensive both in tokens and time. Checkpoints allow instant restoration.\n\n3. **Multi-Agent Handoffs**: When rotating agents due to context window limits, checkpoints enable seamless state transfer.\n\n4. **Debugging and Replay**: Checkpoints provide snapshots for debugging failed sessions and replaying successful patterns.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Checkpoint Types\n\n```typescript\nenum CheckpointTrigger {\n  MANUAL = 'manual',           // User-initiated via API\n  AUTO = 'auto',               // Scheduled interval-based\n  ERROR = 'error',             // Pre-error state capture\n  ROTATION = 'rotation',       // Before agent rotation\n  MILESTONE = 'milestone'      // After significant progress\n}\n\ninterface Checkpoint {\n  id: string;                  // ULID for ordering\n  sessionId: string;\n  trigger: CheckpointTrigger;\n  type: 'full' | 'delta';\n  sequence: number;            // 1-indexed within session\n  parentId?: string;           // For deltas, reference to base\n  \n  // Storage\n  storagePath: string;\n  sizeBytes: number;\n  compressedSizeBytes: number;\n  \n  // Metadata\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  \n  // State summary\n  messageCount: number;\n  tokenCount: number;\n  beadReferences: string[];    // Beads touched in this session\n}\n```\n\n### Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing\n\nThe system uses a delta-based approach to minimize storage while maintaining fast restore times:\n\n1. **Full Checkpoints**: Every 5th checkpoint (sequence % 5 === 0) stores complete state\n2. **Delta Checkpoints**: Intermediate checkpoints store only changes since the last checkpoint\n3. **Bounded Restore Time**: Maximum 4 deltas to apply ensures O(1) restore complexity\n\n```typescript\n// Delta calculation\ninterface DeltaContent {\n  addedMessages: Message[];\n  modifiedMetadata: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e;\n  newBeadRefs: string[];\n  removedBeadRefs: string[];\n  contextWindowDelta: {\n    tokensBefore: number;\n    tokensAfter: number;\n  };\n}\n\n// Restore algorithm\nasync function restore(checkpointId: string): Promise\u003cSessionState\u003e {\n  const checkpoint = await getCheckpoint(checkpointId);\n  \n  if (checkpoint.type === 'full') {\n    return decompress(await readStorage(checkpoint.storagePath));\n  }\n  \n  // Find nearest full checkpoint\n  const chain = await buildRestoreChain(checkpointId);\n  // chain = [fullCheckpoint, delta1, delta2, ..., targetDelta]\n  \n  let state = decompress(await readStorage(chain[0].storagePath));\n  for (let i = 1; i \u003c chain.length; i++) {\n    state = applyDelta(state, chain[i]);\n  }\n  \n  return state;\n}\n```\n\n### Compression Strategy\n\n```typescript\nconst compressionConfig = {\n  algorithm: 'zstd',           // Best ratio for JSON-like data\n  level: 3,                    // Balance between speed and ratio\n  dictionary: true,            // Use trained dictionary for messages\n  \n  // Expected ratios\n  // Full checkpoint: ~4:1 compression\n  // Delta checkpoint: ~10:1 compression (smaller, more repetitive)\n};\n```\n\n### Automatic Compaction\n\nOld delta chains are compacted to reduce storage and simplify restore:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompactionPolicy {\n  // Keep last N full checkpoints\n  retainFullCheckpoints: number;  // Default: 5\n  \n  // Compact deltas older than threshold\n  compactAfterHours: number;      // Default: 24\n  \n  // Delete checkpoints older than threshold\n  deleteAfterDays: number;        // Default: 30\n  \n  // Minimum checkpoints to retain regardless of age\n  minimumRetained: number;        // Default: 3\n}\n\n// Compaction algorithm\nasync function compactSession(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cCompactionResult\u003e {\n  const checkpoints = await getSessionCheckpoints(sessionId);\n  const now = new Date();\n  \n  const result: CompactionResult = {\n    deleted: 0,\n    compacted: 0,\n    freedBytes: 0\n  };\n  \n  // Phase 1: Delete expired checkpoints\n  for (const cp of checkpoints) {\n    if (cp.expiresAt \u0026\u0026 cp.expiresAt \u003c now) {\n      await deleteCheckpoint(cp.id);\n      result.deleted++;\n      result.freedBytes += cp.sizeBytes;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Phase 2: Merge old delta chains into single full checkpoints\n  const oldChains = findCompactableChains(checkpoints, policy.compactAfterHours);\n  for (const chain of oldChains) {\n    const merged = await mergeChainToFull(chain);\n    result.compacted += chain.length - 1;\n    result.freedBytes += chain.reduce((sum, cp) =\u003e sum + cp.sizeBytes, 0) - merged.sizeBytes;\n  }\n  \n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Storage Backend\n\n```typescript\ninterface CheckpointStorage {\n  // Write checkpoint data\n  write(sessionId: string, checkpointId: string, data: Buffer): Promise\u003cstring\u003e;\n  \n  // Read checkpoint data\n  read(path: string): Promise\u003cBuffer\u003e;\n  \n  // Delete checkpoint\n  delete(path: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  // List checkpoints for session\n  list(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cCheckpointMetadata[]\u003e;\n}\n\n// Default: Local filesystem with optional S3 tiering\nclass HybridCheckpointStorage implements CheckpointStorage {\n  constructor(\n    private localPath: string,\n    private s3Client?: S3Client,\n    private tierAfterHours: number = 24\n  ) {}\n  \n  // Hot checkpoints on local SSD\n  // Cold checkpoints tiered to S3\n}\n```\n\n## API Design\n\n### REST Endpoints\n\n```typescript\n// Create manual checkpoint\nPOST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints\nRequest: { trigger?: 'manual', metadata?: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e }\nResponse: { checkpointId: string, type: 'full' | 'delta', sequence: number }\n\n// List checkpoints\nGET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints\nQuery: { limit?: number, before?: string, after?: string }\nResponse: { checkpoints: Checkpoint[], hasMore: boolean }\n\n// Get checkpoint details\nGET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints/:checkpointId\nResponse: Checkpoint\n\n// Restore from checkpoint\nPOST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/restore\nRequest: { checkpointId: string, createNewSession?: boolean }\nResponse: { sessionId: string, restoredFrom: string, messageCount: number }\n\n// Delete checkpoint\nDELETE /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints/:checkpointId\nResponse: { deleted: true }\n```\n\n### WebSocket Events\n\n```typescript\n// Checkpoint created\n{\n  event: 'checkpoint.created',\n  data: {\n    checkpointId: string,\n    sessionId: string,\n    trigger: CheckpointTrigger,\n    type: 'full' | 'delta',\n    sequence: number\n  }\n}\n\n// Checkpoint restored\n{\n  event: 'checkpoint.restored',\n  data: {\n    checkpointId: string,\n    sessionId: string,\n    newSessionId?: string,\n    restorationTimeMs: number\n  }\n}\n\n// Compaction completed\n{\n  event: 'checkpoint.compacted',\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string,\n    deleted: number,\n    compacted: number,\n    freedBytes: number\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n```typescript\ninterface CheckpointConfig {\n  // Auto-checkpoint settings\n  autoCheckpoint: {\n    enabled: boolean;\n    intervalMinutes: number;

The state machine provides a single source of truth for agent status.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n### Why a Formal State Machine?\n- **Correctness**: Only valid transitions are allowed (e.g., can't terminate an already-terminated agent)\n- **Debuggability**: Current and historical states provide clear operational picture\n- **Event-Driven**: State changes trigger appropriate side effects (cleanup, notifications)\n- **Testability**: State machines are easy to unit test exhaustively\n- **Documentation**: The state diagram serves as living documentation\n\n### Why Status Endpoints?\n- **Health Checks**: Load balancers and orchestrators need to check agent health\n- **UI Integration**: Web dashboard displays real-time agent status\n- **Debugging**: Operators can query agent state for troubleshooting\n- **Automation**: External systems can poll for state changes\n\n### Why WebSocket Events?\n- **Real-time Updates**: UI receives instant state change notifications\n- **Reduced Polling**: No need for clients to poll status endpoints\n- **Rich Context**: Events include metadata about state transitions\n- **Scalability**: Pub/sub pattern scales better than polling\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### State Machine Definition\n```typescript\nenum AgentState {\n  SPAWNING = 'spawning',     // Process starting, PTY initializing\n  INITIALIZING = 'initializing', // Agent loading, running init commands\n  READY = 'ready',           // Agent idle, waiting for input\n  EXECUTING = 'executing',   // Agent processing a command/prompt\n  PAUSED = 'paused',         // Agent temporarily suspended\n  TERMINATING = 'terminating', // Graceful shutdown in progress\n  TERMINATED = 'terminated', // Process ended normally\n  FAILED = 'failed',         // Process ended with error\n}\n\n// Valid transitions\nconst transitions = {\n  [AgentState.SPAWNING]: [AgentState.INITIALIZING, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.INITIALIZING]: [AgentState.READY, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.READY]: [AgentState.EXECUTING, AgentState.PAUSED, AgentState.TERMINATING],\n  [AgentState.EXECUTING]: [AgentState.READY, AgentState.PAUSED, AgentState.TERMINATING, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.PAUSED]: [AgentState.READY, AgentState.TERMINATING],\n  [AgentState.TERMINATING]: [AgentState.TERMINATED, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.TERMINATED]: [], // Terminal state\n  [AgentState.FAILED]: [],     // Terminal state\n};\n```\n\n### State Metadata\nEach state transition records:\n- Previous state and new state\n- Timestamp of transition\n- Reason for transition (user action, timeout, error, etc.)\n- Any error details for failure states\n\n### Status Endpoint Design\n```\nGET /api/v1/agents/:agentId/status\nResponse:\n{\n  \"agentId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"state\": \"ready\",\n  \"stateEnteredAt\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"uptime\": 3600,\n  \"lastActivity\": \"2024-01-15T11:25:00Z\",\n  \"healthChecks\": {\n    \"process\": \"healthy\",\n    \"pty\": \"healthy\",\n    \"memory\": \"healthy\"\n  },\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"commandsExecuted\": 42,\n    \"totalOutputBytes\": 102400\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### WebSocket Event Schema\n```typescript\ninterface AgentStateEvent {\n  type: 'agent.state.changed';\n  agentId: string;\n  previousState: AgentState;\n  currentState: AgentState;\n  timestamp: string;\n  reason?: string;\n  error?: {\n    code: string;\n    message: string;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Health Check Strategy\n- **Process Health**: Is the PTY process still running?\n- **Responsiveness**: Did agent respond to last heartbeat?\n- **Memory**: Is agent within memory limits?\n- **Timeout Detection**: Auto-transition to FAILED if unresponsive\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] AgentState enum defines all valid states\n- [ ] State machine validates transitions, throws on invalid\n- [ ] All state transitions are logged with correlation ID\n- [ ] GET /api/v1/agents/:agentId/status returns current state and metadata\n- [ ] WebSocket emits `agent.state.changed` events\n- [ ] Health checks run on configurable interval (default 30s)\n- [ ] Failed health checks trigger state transition to FAILED\n- [ ] State history is queryable for debugging\n- [ ] Unit tests cover all valid transitions\n- [ ] Unit tests verify invalid transitions are rejected\n- [ ] Integration test for spawn -\u003e ready -\u003e executing -\u003e ready flow\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Core Service\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/agent.service.ts` -

Agents need intelligent guidance on **how** to resolve conflicts, not just notification that conflicts exist.\n\nKey challenges that require intelligent resolution:\n- **Priority ambiguity**: Multiple BVs may have similar urgency levels\n- **Progress asymmetry**: One agent may be 90% done while another just started\n- **Resource interdependence**: File A's conflict may cascade to files B, C, D\n- **Historical patterns**: CASS data reveals which resolution strategies worked before\n- **Human context**: Some conflicts require escalation to human decision-makers\n\nWithout intelligent resolution assistance, agents either deadlock waiting for each other, or humans must manually intervene in every conflict—neither scales.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Resolution Strategy Types\n\n| Strategy | Description | When Applied |\n|----------|-------------|--------------|\n| `wait` | Requesting agent waits for holder to complete | Holder near completion (\u003e80% progress) |\n| `split` | Divide resource into non-overlapping segments | File can be logically partitioned |\n| `transfer` | Current holder yields to higher-priority agent | Significant priority differential |\n| `coordinate` | Both agents collaborate on shared resource | Complementary work patterns detected |\n| `escalate` | Route to human decision-maker | High-risk or ambiguous situations |\n\n### Input Sources\n\nThe resolution engine synthesizes data from multiple sources:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 Conflict Resolution Engine                   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  Inputs:                                                     │\n│  ├── BV Priorities (urgency, business value, deadlines)     │\n│  ├── Checkpoint Progress (% complete, time invested)         │\n│  ├── CASS History (past resolution outcomes, patterns)       │\n│  ├── Current Reservations (lock duration, scope)             │\n│  └── Agent Capabilities (can agent handle split work?)       │\n│                                                              │\n│  Processing:                                                 │\n│  ├── Strategy Scoring (each strategy scored 0-100)          │\n│  ├── Risk Assessment (what could go wrong?)                  │\n│  └── Evidence Compilation (why this recommendation?)         │\n│                                                              │\n│  Output:                                                     │\n│  └── ResolutionSuggestion (strategy + confidence + rationale)│\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Confidence Scoring (0-100)\n\nConfidence scores indicate how certain the system is about a recommendation:\n\n| Range | Interpretation | Auto-Resolution |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 90-100 | Very high confidence | Auto-apply allowed |\n| 70-89 | High confidence | Auto-apply with notification |\n| 50-69 | Moderate confidence | Requires agent confirmation |\n| 30-49 | Low confidence | Requires human review |\n| 0-29 | Very low confidence | Escalate immediately |\n\n**Evidence categories** contributing to confidence:\n- Priority differential clarity (+/- 20 points)\n- Progress state certainty (+/- 15 points)\n- Historical pattern match (+/- 25 points)\n- Resource criticality assessment (+/- 20 points)\n- Time pressure factors (+/- 20 points)\n\n### Auto-Resolution Rules\n\nLow-risk conflicts can be resolved automatically when:\n1.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-41h","title":"CAAM Account Management (BYOA + Rotation)","description":"## Overview\n\nCAAM (Coding Agent Account Manager) is the **account/profile orchestration layer** for Flywheel Gateway. It is designed for **BYOA (Bring Your Own Account)** subscription logins by default, with optional **BYOK (API key)** support for advanced automation use cases.\n\n**Non-negotiable security invariant:** OAuth credentials are never stored in Gateway's central database. All auth artifacts live inside each workspace's isolated environment, managed by CAAM. Gateway only stores **non-sensitive metadata** (presence, hashes, timestamps, health).\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nAgents consume API tokens fast. Without CAAM, you hit rate limits and stall. With CAAM, you have automatic failover across multiple keys and providers.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **BYOA first** — subscription accounts (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) are the default path\n2. **No credential custody** — Gateway never sees Google/Anthropic/OpenAI logins or passwords\n3. **workspace-local auth artifacts** — tokens remain inside the workspace container/volume\n4. **Minimum requirement** — at least one verified provider to activate; recommended: 1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro\n5. **Provider parity** — Claude, Codex, and Gemini are all supported\n6. **Autonomous rotation** — cooldown + rotation is automated via CAAM\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Account \u0026 Profile Data Model\n\n```typescript\ntype ProviderId = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\ntype AuthMode = 'oauth_browser' | 'device_code' | 'api_key';\n\ninterface AccountProfile {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  name: string;               // Profile label (e.g., \"work\", \"alice@gmail.com\")\n  authMode: AuthMode;\n\n  // Status \u0026 health (no secrets)\n  status: 'unlinked' | 'linked' | 'verified' | 'expired' | 'cooldown' | 'error';\n  statusMessage?: string;\n  lastVerifiedAt?: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  cooldownUntil?: Date;\n  lastUsedAt?: Date;\n  healthScore?: number;       // 0..100\n\n  // Auth artifacts (metadata only)\n  artifacts: {\n    authFilesPresent: boolean;\n    authFileHash?: string;    // hash for change detection\n    storageMode?: 'file' | 'keyring' | 'unknown';\n  };\n\n  labels?: string[];\n  createdAt: Date;\n  updatedAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AccountPool {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  profileIds: string[];\n  rotationStrategy: 'smart' | 'round_robin' | 'least_recent' | 'random';\n  cooldownMinutesDefault: number;\n  maxRetries: number;\n}\n```\n\n### CAAM Runner Interface\n\nCAAM runs **inside each workspace container**.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-45c","title":"Context Pack Builder with Token Budgeting","description":"## Background\n\nThe Context Pack Builder is the core orchestration component that assembles optimized context for agent prompts. It pulls from multiple data sources (Bead Valuation, Collective Memory, CASS) and intelligently allocates token budget to maximize prompt effectiveness while respecting model limits.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Agent Effectiveness**: Agents perform better with relevant, well-structured context. Random or poorly-prioritized context leads to confusion and errors.\n\n2. **Token Efficiency**: Model context windows are expensive. Every token must earn its place through relevance and utility.\n\n3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Different tasks require different context mixes. A debugging task needs error history; a planning task needs project structure.\n\n4. **Budget Compliance**: Exceeding context limits causes truncation or errors. Strict budget management ensures predictable behavior.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Context Pack Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface ContextPack {\n  id: string;                    // ULID for tracking\n  sessionId: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  \n  // Budget tracking\n  budget: {\n    total: number;               // Total tokens available\n    used: number;                // Tokens used\n    remaining: number;           // Tokens remaining\n    breakdown: TokenBreakdown;   // Per-section allocation\n  };\n  \n  // Context sections\n  sections: {\n    triage: TriageSection;       // From Bead Valuation\n    memory: MemorySection;       // From Collective Memory\n    search: SearchSection;       // From CASS\n    history: HistorySection;     // Recent conversation\n    system: SystemSection;       // System prompts\n  };\n  \n  // Metadata\n  metadata: {\n    buildTimeMs: number;\n    sourcesQueried: string[];\n    truncations: TruncationRecord[];\n  };\n}\n\ninterface TokenBreakdown {\n  system: number;                // System prompt allocation\n  triage: number;                // Triage beads allocation\n  memory: number;                // Memory rules allocation\n  search: number;                // Search results allocation\n  history: number;               // Conversation history allocation\n  reserved: number;              // Reserved for response\n}\n```\n\n### Token Budget Allocation Strategy\n\n```typescript\ninterface BudgetStrategy {\n  // Fixed allocations (absolute tokens)\n  fixed: {\n    system: number;              // System prompt, typically 500-1000\n    reserved: number;            // Response buffer, typically 2000-4000\n  };\n  \n  // Proportional allocations (% of remaining)\n  proportional: {\n    triage: number;              // Default: 0.30 (30%)\n    memory: number;              // Default: 0.20 (20%)\n    search: number;              // Default: 0.25 (25%)\n    history: number;             // Default: 0.25 (25%)\n  };\n  \n  // Minimum allocations (floor)\n  minimums: {\n    triage: number;              // At least 500 tokens\n    memory: number;              // At least 300 tokens\n    search: number;              // At least 500 tokens\n    history: number;             // At least 1000 tokens\n  };\n  \n  // Priority order for overflow redistribution\n  priority: ('triage' | 'memory' | 'search' | 'history')[];\n}\n\n// Default strategy\nconst defaultStrategy: BudgetStrategy = {\n  fixed: { system: 800, reserved: 3000 },\n  proportional: { triage: 0.30, memory: 0.20, search: 0.25, history: 0.25 },\n  minimums: { triage: 500, memory: 300, search: 500, history: 1000 },\n  priority: ['triage', 'history', 'search', 'memory']\n};\n\nfunction allocateBudget(\n  totalTokens: number,\n  strategy: BudgetStrategy\n): TokenBreakdown {\n  const available = totalTokens -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-46c","title":"FEAT: WebSocket Infrastructure with Durable Ring Buffers","description":"## Background\n\nReal-time communication is essential for the Flywheel Gateway. Clients need instant updates when:\n- Agent output streams in (stdout, stderr, tool results)\n- Agent state changes (ready, executing, terminated)\n- Conflicts arise requiring human resolution\n- Mail arrives from other agents\n- Reservations are acquired or released\n\nWebSocket connections are inherently unreliable - networks drop, clients reconnect. The ring buffer system ensures no messages are lost during brief disconnections by allowing cursor-based replay.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why Ring Buffers?\n- **Bounded Memory**: Fixed-size buffers prevent memory exhaustion from slow consumers\n- **Fast Replay**: Clients reconnecting after brief disconnects get caught up instantly\n- **Cursor-Based**: Opaque cursors allow stateless servers (cursor encodes position)\n- **TTL Expiry**: Old messages automatically expire, keeping buffers fresh\n\n### Why Per-Channel Buffers?\n- **Isolation**: High-volume channels (output) don't starve low-volume ones (conflicts)\n- **Tuning**: Different channels can have different buffer sizes and TTLs\n- **Permissions**: Subscription authorization is per-channel\n\n### Hub Architecture\nThe WebSocket hub acts as a message broker:\n1. Publishers (drivers, API handlers) push messages to topics\n2. Hub fans out to all subscribed connections\n3. Each channel maintains its own ring buffer\n4. Connections track their cursor per channel\n\n## Scope \u0026 Requirements\n\n### WebSocket Hub\n\n```typescript\ninterface WebSocketHub {\n  // Connection management\n  addConnection(ws: WebSocket, auth: AuthContext): ConnectionHandle;\n  removeConnection(connectionId: string): void;\n  \n  // Subscriptions\n  subscribe(connectionId: string, channel: Channel, cursor?: string): void;\n  unsubscribe(connectionId: string, channel: Channel): void;\n  \n  // Publishing\n  publish(channel: Channel, message: HubMessage): void;\n  \n  // Replay\n  replay(channel: Channel, cursor: string, limit?: number): HubMessage[];\n  \n  // Monitoring\n  getStats(): HubStats;\n}\n\ninterface ConnectionHandle {\n  connectionId: string;\n  connectedAt: Date;\n  subscriptions: Set\u003cChannel\u003e;\n  lastHeartbeat: Date;\n  cursor: Map\u003cChannel, string\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface HubStats {\n  activeConnections: number;\n  subscriptionsByChannel: Map\u003cChannel, number\u003e;\n  messagesPerSecond: number;\n  bufferUtilization: Map\u003cChannel, number\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Channel Types\n\n```typescript\ntype Channel = \n  // Agent-scoped channels\n  | { type: 'agent:output'; agentId: string }\n  | { type: 'agent:state'; agentId: string }\n  | { type: 'agent:tools'; agentId: string }\n  \n  // workspace-scoped channels\n  | { type: 'workspace:agents'; workspaceId: string }\n  | { type: 'workspace:reservations'; workspaceId: string }\n  | { type: 'workspace:conflicts'; workspaceId: string }\n  \n  // User-scoped channels\n  | { type: 'user:mail'; userId: string }\n  | { type: 'user:notifications'; userId: string }\n  \n  // System channels\n  | { type: 'system:health' }\n  | { type: 'system:metrics' };\n\n// Channel string format: \"type:id\" e.g., \"agent:output:agent-abc123\"\nfunction channelToString(channel: Channel): string;\nfunction parseChannel(str: string): Channel;\n```\n\n### Ring Buffer Implementation\n\n```typescript\ninterface RingBuffer\u003cT\u003e {\n  capacity: number;\n  ttlMs: number;\n  \n  push(item: T): string;              // Returns cursor\n  get(cursor: string): T | undefined;\n  slice(cursor: string, limit?: number): T[];\n  getLatestCursor(): string;\n  \n  // Maintenance\n  prune(): number;                    // Remove expired, return count\n  clear(): void;\n  \n  // Stats\n  size(): number;\n  oldestCursor(): string | undefined;\n}\n\n// Cursor format: base64(timestamp:sequence)\n// Allows cursor comparison without buffer access\ninterface CursorData {\n  timestamp: number;\n  sequence: number;\n}\n\nfunction encodeCursor(data: CursorData): string;\nfunction decodeCursor(cursor: string): CursorData;\nfunction compareCursors(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1;\n```\n\n### Buffer Configuration Per Channel Type\n\n```typescript\nconst BUFFER_CONFIG: Record\u003cstring, BufferConfig\u003e = {\n  'agent:output': {\n    capacity: 10000,    // High volume, many messages\n    ttlMs: 300000,      // 5 minutes - reconnect window\n  },\n  'agent:state': {\n    capacity: 100,      // Low volume\n    ttlMs: 3600000,     // 1 hour - state history\n  },\n  'workspace:conflicts': {\n    capacity: 500,\n    ttlMs: 1800000,     // 30 minutes\n  },\n  'user:mail': {\n    capacity: 1000,\n    ttlMs: 86400000,    // 24 hours - important messages\n  },\n  'system:health': {\n    capacity: 60,       // 1 per second\n    ttlMs: 60000,       // 1 minute\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Message Format\n\n```typescript\ninterface HubMessage {\n  id: string;                    // UUID for deduplication\n  cursor: string;                // Ring buffer cursor\n  timestamp: Date;\n  channel: string;               // Serialized channel\n  \n  type: MessageType;\n  payload: unknown;              // Type-specific payload\n  \n  metadata?: {\n    correlationId?: string;\n    agentId?: string;\n    userId?: string;\n    workspaceId?: string;\n  };\n}\n\ntype MessageType =\n  | 'output.chunk'\n  | 'state.change'\n  | 'tool.start'\n  | 'tool.end'\n  | 'reservation.acquired'\n  | 'reservation.released'\n  | 'conflict.detected'\n  | 'conflict.resolved'\n  | 'mail.received'\n  | 'health.ping'\n  | 'error';\n```\n\n### Heartbeat Protocol\n\n```typescript\n// Client sends ping every 30 seconds\ninterface PingMessage {\n  type: 'ping';\n  timestamp: number;\n}\n\n// Server responds with pong + connection stats\ninterface PongMessage {\n  type: 'pong';\n  timestamp: number;\n  serverTime: number;\n  subscriptions: string[];\n  cursors: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n}\n\n// Server sends heartbeat every 30 seconds to all connections\ninterface HeartbeatMessage {\n  type: 'heartbeat';\n  serverTime: number;\n}\n\n// Connection considered dead after 90 seconds without ping\nconst HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 30000;\nconst CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 90000;\n```\n\n### Reconnection Flow\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Client connects with last known cursors\ninterface ReconnectRequest {\n  type: 'reconnect';\n  cursors: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e;  // channel -\u003e cursor\n}\n\n// 2. Server validates cursors, replays missed messages\ninterface ReconnectResponse {\n  type: 'reconnect_ack';\n  replayed: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e; // channel -\u003e message count\n  expired: string[];                // channels where cursor expired\n  newCursors: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n}\n\n// 3. If cursor expired, client can either:\n//    a. Accept current cursor (lose messages)\n//    b. Re-fetch state via REST API\n```\n\n### Authorization\n\n```typescript\ninterface ChannelAuthorization {\n  canSubscribe(auth: AuthContext, channel: Channel): boolean;\n  canPublish(auth: AuthContext, channel: Channel): boolean;\n}\n\n// Example rules:\n// - agent:output:X requires read access to agent X\n// - workspace:conflicts:X requires workspace X membership\n// - user:mail:X requires being user X\n// - system:health requires authenticated connection\n```\n\n## File Structure\n\n```\napps/gateway/src/ws/\n├── index.ts                 # Public exports\n├── hub.ts                   # WebSocketHub implementation\n├── connection.ts            # Connection lifecycle management\n├── channels.ts              # Channel types and parsing\n├── ring-buffer.ts           # Generic ring buffer implementation\n├── cursor.ts                # Cursor encoding/decoding\n├── heartbeat.ts             # Heartbeat manager\n├── authorization.ts         # Channel access control\n├── messages.ts              # Message type definitions\n├── reconnect.ts             # Reconnection handling\n└── __tests__/\n    ├── hub.test.ts\n    ├── ring-buffer.test.ts\n    ├── cursor.test.ts\n    └── reconnect.test.ts\n```\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md §9 -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-5nm","title":"File Reservation System","description":"## Background\n\nThe File Reservation System prevents file conflicts when multiple agents work in the same codebase. Without coordination, agents might simultaneously modify the same file, leading to merge conflicts, lost work, or inconsistent state.\n\nThis system provides glob-based file reservations with two modes:\n- **Exclusive**: Only the reservation holder can modify matching files\n- **Shared**: Multiple agents can read, one can write with coordination\n\nReservations are TTL-based to prevent deadlocks from crashed or stuck agents.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Reservation Model\n```typescript\ninterface FileReservation {\n  id: string;                    // UUID\n  projectId: string;             // Project scope\n  agentId: string;               // Reserving agent\n  patterns: string[];            // Glob patterns\n  mode: 'exclusive' | 'shared';  // Reservation type\n  ttl: number;                   // Time-to-live in seconds\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n  renewCount: number;            // Number of renewals\n  metadata: {\n    reason?: string;             // Why reserved\n    taskId?: string;             // Associated task\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Glob Pattern Matching\nUses `micromatch` for fast, accurate glob matching:\n```typescript\n// Example patterns\n'src/**/*.ts'           // All TypeScript in src\n'!src/**/*.test.ts'     // Exclude tests\n'packages/core/src/*'   // Direct children only\n'**/{package,tsconfig}.json'  // Specific files anywhere\n```\n\n### Core Operations\n\n#### 1. Create Reservation\n```typescript\nasync createReservation(params: {\n  projectId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  patterns: string[];\n  mode: 'exclusive' | 'shared';\n  ttl?: number;          // Default: 300 (5 minutes)\n  reason?: string;\n}): Promise\u003c{\n  reservation: FileReservation;\n  conflicts: ConflictInfo[];  // Empty if granted\n  granted: boolean;\n}\u003e\n```\n\n#### 2. Check Reservation\n```typescript\nasync checkReservation(params: {\n  projectId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  filePath: string;\n}): Promise\u003c{\n  allowed: boolean;\n  heldBy?: string;        // Agent holding reservation\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  mode?: 'exclusive' | 'shared';\n}\u003e\n```\n\n#### 3. Release Reservation\n```typescript\nasync releaseReservation(params: {\n  reservationId: string;\n  agentId: string;        // Must match holder\n}): Promise\u003c{ released: boolean }\u003e\n```\n\n#### 4. Renew Reservation\n```typescript\nasync renewReservation(params: {\n  reservationId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  additionalTtl?: number; // Default: original TTL\n}): Promise\u003c{\n  renewed: boolean;\n  newExpiresAt: Date;\n}\u003e\n```\n\n#### 5. List Reservations\n```typescript\nasync listReservations(params: {\n  projectId: string;\n  agentId?: string;       // Filter by agent\n  filePath?: string;      // Filter by affected file\n}): Promise\u003cFileReservation[]\u003e\n```\n\n### Conflict Detection Algorithm\n\nWhen a new reservation is requested:\n1. Expand all patterns to a set of potential file paths\n2. For each existing reservation in the project:\n   a. Expand its patterns\n   b. Compute intersection with new patterns\n   c. If intersection non-empty AND modes conflict, record conflict\n3. Return conflicts or grant reservation\n\n```typescript\nfunction detectConflicts(\n  newPatterns: string[],\n  newMode: ReservationMode,\n  existingReservations: FileReservation[]\n): ConflictInfo[] {\n  const conflicts: ConflictInfo[] = [];\n  \n  for (const existing of existingReservations) {\n    const overlap = computePatternOverlap(newPatterns, existing.patterns);\n    \n    if (overlap.length \u003e 0) {\n      // Exclusive conflicts with everything\n      // Shared only conflicts with exclusive\n      if (existing.mode === 'exclusive' || newMode === 'exclusive') {\n        conflicts.push({\n          reservationId: existing.id,\n          agentId: existing.agentId,\n          overlappingPatterns: overlap,\n          expiresAt: existing.expiresAt\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return conflicts;\n}\n```\n\n### TTL Management\n\n- Background job runs every 10 seconds\n- Expired reservations are marked and cleaned\n- Agents can subscribe to expiration warnings (30s before)\n- Maximum TTL: 1 hour (configurable)\n- Maximum renewals: 10 (prevents indefinite locks)\n\n## UI Components\n\n### Reservation Map View\nVisual representation of current reservations:\n```\nProject: flywheel-gateway\n==========================\n\n[Agent: architect-001] (exclusive, expires in 4:32)\n  - src/services/**/*.ts\n  - src/models/**/*.ts\n\n[Agent: coder-002] (shared, expires in 2:15)\n  - src/utils/*.ts\n  - src/helpers/*.ts\n\n[Agent: tester-003] (exclusive, expires in 8:45)\n  - **/*.test.ts\n  - **/*.spec.ts\n\nConflicts: None\n```\n\n### Real-time Updates\n- WebSocket subscription for reservation changes\n- Live conflict notifications\n- Expiration countdown timers\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/reservation.service.ts` | Core reservation logic |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/reservation.types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/reservation.store.ts` | Storage abstraction |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/pattern-matcher.ts` | Glob pattern utilities |\n| `apps/gateway/src/controllers/reservation.controller.ts` | REST API endpoints |\n| `apps/gateway/src/websocket/reservation.gateway.ts` | WebSocket handlers |\n| `apps/gateway/src/jobs/reservation-cleanup.job.ts` | TTL enforcement |\n| `apps/web/src/components/ReservationMap.tsx` | UI component |\n| `apps/gateway/src/__tests__/reservation.service.test.ts` | Unit tests |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create, check, release, renew, list operations\n- [ ] Glob pattern matching with negation support\n- [ ] Exclusive vs shared mode semantics\n- [ ] Conflict detection for overlapping patterns\n- [ ] TTL-based automatic expiration\n- [ ] Maximum renewal limit enforcement\n- [ ] REST API endpoints for all operations\n- [ ] WebSocket events for real-time updates\n- [ ] Reservation map UI component\n- [ ] Background cleanup job for expired reservations\n- [ ] \u003e95% test coverage for conflict detection\n- [ ] Performance: \u003c50ms for conflict check with 100 active reservations\n- [ ] Documentation with usage examples\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md Section 11: File Coordination\n- PLAN.md Section 12: Conflict Prevention\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `micromatch` - Glob pattern matching\n- `ioredis` - Redis for distributed state\n- `cron` - Background job scheduling\n- Socket.io for WebSocket support\n\n## Edge Cases to Handle\n\n1. Agent requests pattern that is subset of own existing reservation\n2. Agent crashes without releasing reservation\n3. Two agents request overlapping patterns simultaneously\n4. Pattern expansion exceeds memory limits (cap at 10,000 files)\n5. Reservation renewal race conditions\n6.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","title":"FEAT: DCG Integration (Destructive Command Guard)","description":"## Background\n\nDCG (Destructive Command Guard) is an external Rust binary and shell hook that **mechanically enforces command safety** at the exact execution boundary. It blocks dangerous commands (or warns) *before* they run, with very low latency.\n\nFlywheel Gateway’s job is **integration and visibility**, not re-implementing DCG.\n\n- DCG already blocks: destructive git ops, dangerous filesystem ops, risky DB commands, etc.\n- Gateway must surface DCG decisions in the agent UX, preserve an audit trail, and provide UI to manage allowlists/config.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Visibility**: show DCG blocks/warnings inline in agent output and in a dedicated dashboard.\n2. **Governance**: manage per-project / per-agent allowlists and enabled packs via UI + REST.\n3. **Safety workflow**: route high-severity blocks into the SLB approval queue; critical blocks are always denied.\n4. **Learning loop**: capture false-positive feedback and feed it into CM (Cass-Memory) to reduce repeats.\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Rebuilding DCG’s pack/pattern engine in TypeScript.\n- Providing a bypass mechanism that defeats DCG’s mechanical enforcement.\n\n## Data Model (source of truth)\n\n```ts\n// packages/shared/src/types/dcg.ts\n\nexport interface DCGBlockEvent {\n  id: string;\n  timestamp: Date;\n  agentId: string;\n  command: string;\n  pack: string;

`critical` is always denied.\n- [ ] Missing/disabled DCG degrades gracefully (feature reported unavailable; no crashes).\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Block event parsing validates schema and applies redaction/sanitization rules\n- [ ] Severity + allowlist rules are deterministic for the same event inputs\n- [ ] Config update validation prevents invalid pack names and invalid allowlist entries\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Ingest a representative block event → persisted + exposed via REST + emitted via WS\n- [ ] Allowlist add/remove → reflected in config response and audited\n\n### E2E Tests (UI)\n- [ ] DCG block appears in dashboard with sanitized command preview and correct severity badge\n- [ ] Allowlist flow requires a reason and updates stats\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + dcgEventId + severity + pack + ruleId; secrets are never logged\n","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T13:32:38.611877216-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T02:41:05.182836004-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-w55","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T14:01:55.818443693-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-6mn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T14:01:58.006237178-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T17:51:59.889823015-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-46c","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T17:52:04.923256682-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-r3p","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T17:52:09.978965354-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
{"id":"flywheel_gateway-61i","title":"Agent Mail Integration (MCP Client)","description":"## Background\n\nAgent Mail provides MCP-based (Model Context Protocol) inter-agent communication within the Flywheel ecosystem. This enables agents to collaborate, delegate tasks, share context, and coordinate their activities without requiring direct connections.\n\nThe mail system uses a message queue architecture where agents send messages to named mailboxes. This decouples senders from receivers and enables asynchronous communication patterns essential for multi-agent orchestration.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### MCP Integration\nAgent Mail is exposed as an MCP server that agents connect to as clients. This leverages the standard MCP tool-calling mechanism for all mail operations:\n\n```typescript\n// MCP Tools exposed by Agent Mail\ntools: [\n  'agentmail_ensure_project',    // Create/verify project exists\n  'agentmail_register_agent',    // Register agent in project\n  'agentmail_send_message',      // Send message to agent\n  'agentmail_reply',             // Reply to received message\n  'agentmail_fetch_inbox',       // Get pending messages\n  'agentmail_request_file_reservation'  // Request file lock\n]\n```\n\n### Message Structure\n```typescript\ninterface AgentMailMessage {\n  id: string;                    // UUID\n  projectId: string;             // Project context\n  from: AgentIdentity;           // Sender agent\n  to: AgentIdentity;             // Recipient agent\n  subject: string;               // Message subject\n  body: any;                     // Structured content (JSON)\n  replyTo?: string;              // Parent message ID for threads\n  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent';\n  ttl: number;                   // Time-to-live in seconds\n  metadata: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e; // Extension point\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Core Operations\n\n#### 1. Ensure Project\nIdempotently creates a project context for agent communication:\n```typescript\nagentmail_ensure_project({\n  projectId: string,\n  name: string,\n  metadata?: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e\n}): { projectId: string, created: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 2. Register Agent\nRegisters an agent to receive messages in a project:\n```typescript\nagentmail_register_agent({\n  projectId: string,\n  agentId: string,\n  capabilities: string[],\n  metadata?: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e\n}): { registered: boolean, mailboxId: string }\n```\n\n#### 3. Send Message\nSends a message to another agent's mailbox:\n```typescript\nagentmail_send_message({\n  projectId: string,\n  to: string,           // Agent ID\n  subject: string,\n  body: any,\n  priority?: Priority,\n  ttl?: number          // Default: 3600 (1 hour)\n}): { messageId: string, delivered: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 4. Reply\nReplies to a received message, maintaining thread context:\n```typescript\nagentmail_reply({\n  messageId: string,    // Original message to reply to\n  body: any,\n  priority?: Priority\n}): { replyId: string, delivered: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 5. Fetch Inbox\nRetrieves pending messages for an agent:\n```typescript\nagentmail_fetch_inbox({\n  projectId: string,\n  agentId: string,\n  limit?: number,       // Default: 50\n  since?: Date,\n  priority?: Priority   // Filter by priority\n}): { messages: AgentMailMessage[], hasMore: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 6. Request File Reservation\nRequests a file reservation through the mail system:\n```typescript\nagentmail_request_file_reservation({\n  projectId: string,\n  requesterId: string,\n  patterns: string[],   // Glob patterns\n  exclusive: boolean,\n  duration: number      // Seconds\n}): { reservationId: string, granted: boolean, conflicts?: string[] }\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### MCP Server Configuration\n```typescript\nconst mcpServer = new MCPServer({\n  name: 'flywheel-agentmail',\n  version: '1.0.0',\n  capabilities: {\n    tools: true,\n    resources: false,\n    prompts: false\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Message Queue Backend\n- In-memory queue for development\n- Redis-backed queue for production\n- PostgreSQL for message persistence and history\n- Configurable retention policies\n\n### Delivery Guarantees\n- At-least-once delivery with idempotency keys\n- Dead letter queue for undeliverable messages\n- Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)\n- Delivery confirmation via acknowledgment\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/index.ts` | Public exports |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/mcp-server.ts` | MCP server implementation |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/tools/` | Individual MCP tool handlers |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/queue.ts` | Message queue abstraction |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/storage/` | Storage adapters (memory, Redis, Postgres) |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/__tests__/` | Test suites |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] MCP server with all 6 tools implemented\n- [ ] Tool input/output schema validation\n- [ ] Message persistence across restarts\n- [ ] Thread support via replyTo chains\n- [ ] Priority queue ordering (urgent \u003e high \u003e normal \u003e low)\n- [ ] TTL enforcement with automatic expiration\n- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed deliveries\n- [ ] At-least-once delivery guarantee\n- [ ] Redis adapter for production\n- [ ] PostgreSQL adapter for persistence\n- [ ] \u003e90% test coverage\n- [ ] Integration tests with mock agents\n- [ ] Performance: handle 1000 msgs/sec\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md Section 10: Inter-Agent Communication\n- PLAN.md Section 11: Agent Mail Protocol\n- MCP Specification: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP SDK\n- `ioredis` - Redis client\n- `pg` - PostgreSQL client\n- Shared types from `@flywheel/types`\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Validate agent identity before message access\n- Enforce project-level isolation\n- Rate limit message sending (default: 100/min/agent)\n- Sanitize message body content\n- Encrypt sensitive message content at rest\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Client request/response schemas validate and map errors into shared taxonomy\n- [ ] Availability/health caching behaves as intended (TTL, invalidate)\n- [ ] Macro helpers (start session, reservations cycle) compose correctly\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Against a local/mock Agent Mail server: ensure_project/register_agent/send_message/fetch_inbox work end-to-end\n- [ ] File reservation conflict scenarios are handled and surfaced to callers with clear details\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Server unreachable/timeouts → graceful degradation and actionable error hints\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-66n","title":"FEAT: Flywheel Velocity Dashboard","description":"## Background\n\nThe Flywheel methodology is built on the premise of continuous improvement - each cycle through Plan, Coordinate, Execute, Scan, and Remember should be faster and more effective than the last. The Velocity Dashboard provides a quantitative measure of this improvement, enabling operators to understand how well their Flywheel ecosystem is accelerating and where friction exists.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nVelocity measurement is crucial because:\n- **Validates the Flywheel Concept**: Proves that the system is actually improving over time\n- **Identifies Bottlenecks**: Highlights which stages are slowing down the cycle\n- **Guides Investment**: Shows where improvements will have the most impact\n- **Motivates Teams**: Visible progress encourages continued adoption\n\nThe velocity score provides a single, intuitive metric (0-100) that captures overall ecosystem health, while detailed stage metrics enable diagnosis and optimization.\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Velocity Score Calculation\n\n**Composite Score (0-100):**\n```typescript\ninterface VelocityScore {\n  overall_score: number; // 0-100\n  timestamp: Date;\n  period: '24h' | '7d' | '30d';\n  \n  components: {\n    throughput_score: number;      // Weight: 25%\n    cycle_time_score: number;      // Weight: 25%\n    success_rate_score: number;    // Weight: 20%\n    learning_rate_score: number;   // Weight: 20%\n    collaboration_score: number;   // Weight: 10%\n  };\n  \n  trend: 'accelerating' | 'stable' | 'decelerating';\n  trend_magnitude: number; // percentage change\n}\n```\n\n**Component Calculations:**\n\n1. **Throughput Score (25%):**\n   -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-6ix","title":"FEAT: Output Streaming System","description":"## Background\n\nAI coding agents produce substantial output during execution - code analysis, file operations, command results, and thinking processes. Users need to see this output in real-time for interactive workflows, while also being able to retrieve historical output for review and debugging.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n### Why Real-time Streaming?\n- **User Experience**: Watching output appear live is essential for interactive agent use\n- **Progress Visibility**: Long-running operations show incremental progress\n- **Early Termination**: Users can stop agents early if output shows wrong direction\n- **Debugging**: See exactly what the agent is doing as it works\n\n### Why Output Buffering?\n- **Reconnection Support**: Users can disconnect and reconnect without losing output\n- **Historical Review**: Examine what an agent did after the fact\n- **Sharing**: Share output logs with teammates for collaboration\n- **Compliance**: Some use cases require output retention for audit\n\n### Why Separate REST + WebSocket?\n- **WebSocket for Live**: Low-latency push of new output chunks\n- **REST for History**: Simple retrieval of past output with pagination\n- **Flexibility**: Clients choose their consumption pattern\n- **Graceful Degradation**: REST works even if WebSocket fails\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### PTY Output Handling\n```typescript\ninterface OutputChunk {\n  id: string;              // UUID v7 for ordering\n  agentId: string;\n  sessionId: string;\n  timestamp: string;       // ISO 8601\n  streamType: 'stdout' | 'stderr' | 'system';\n  content: string;         // Raw output content\n  encoding: 'utf-8' | 'base64'; // Base64 for binary\n  sequence: number;        // Monotonic sequence number\n}\n```\n\n### Buffering Strategy\n- **Ring Buffer**: Keep last N chunks in memory (configurable, default 1000)\n- **Persistence**: Write to database for long-term storage\n- **Compression**: Compress older chunks to save space\n- **TTL**: Auto-delete output older than retention period\n\n### Streaming Implementation\n1. PTY data event fires\n2. Parse into output chunks\n3. Assign sequence number and timestamp\n4. Emit to WebSocket subscribers\n5. Push to ring buffer\n6.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-6mn","title":"FEAT: Database Schema and Drizzle Setup","description":"## Overview\n\nflywheel_gateway uses **SQLite with Drizzle ORM** for persistent storage. This combination provides type-safe database access, automatic migration management, and excellent performance for the gateway's workload characteristics. WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode enables concurrent read/write access without blocking.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\n### Why SQLite?\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Single-file database with no external dependencies\n2. **Bun-Native**: First-class SQLite support in Bun runtime via `bun:sqlite`\n3. **Performance**: Sub-millisecond queries for typical workloads\n4. **WAL Mode**: Concurrent readers don't block writers (and vice versa)\n5. **Portability**: Easy backup, replication, and disaster recovery\n6. **Proven Scale**: SQLite handles millions of rows with proper indexing\n\n### Why Drizzle ORM?\n\n1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript inference from schema to queries\n2. **SQL-Like API**: Familiar syntax, no magic strings\n3. **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit generates and applies migrations\n4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead compared to raw SQL\n5. **Bun Support**: Native integration with Bun's SQLite driver\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Database Tables\n\nAll tables from PLAN.md §29.1:\n\n#### Core Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `agents` | Active and historical agent records | id, repoUrl, task, status, model, createdAt |\n| `checkpoints` | Agent state snapshots for resume | id, agentId, state, createdAt |\n| `accounts` | User accounts and API keys | id, email, apiKeyHash, role, createdAt |\n| `history` | Command execution history | id, agentId, command, input, output, durationMs |\n\n#### Monitoring \u0026 Audit Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `alerts` | System alerts and notifications | id, severity, message, acknowledged, createdAt |\n| `auditLogs` | Security and compliance audit trail | id, accountId, action, resource, metadata, createdAt |\n\n#### DCG (Derived Code Governance) Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `dcgBlocks` | Blocked operations and reasons | id, pattern, reason, createdBy, createdAt |\n| `dcgAllowlist` | Explicitly allowed operations | id, pattern, approvedBy, expiresAt |\n\n#### Fleet Management Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `fleetRepos` | Repositories in the managed fleet | id, url, branch, lastSyncAt, status |\n| `agentSweeps` | Bulk agent operations | id, query, action, status, affectedCount |\n\n### Schema Definition\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts\nimport { sqliteTable, text, integer, blob } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';\n\nexport const agents = sqliteTable('agents', {\n  id: text('id').primaryKey(),\n  repoUrl: text('repo_url').notNull(),\n  task: text('task').notNull(),\n  status: text('status').notNull().default('idle'),\n  model: text('model').notNull().default('sonnet-4'),\n  accountId: text('account_id').references(() =\u003e accounts.id),\n  createdAt: integer('created_at', { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),\n  updatedAt: integer('updated_at', { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),\n});\n\nexport const checkpoints = sqliteTable('checkpoints', {\n  id: text('id').primaryKey(),\n  agentId: text('agent_id').references(() =\u003e agents.id).notNull(),\n  state: blob('state', { mode: 'json' }).notNull(),\n  createdAt: integer('created_at', { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),\n});\n\n// ... additional tables\n```\n\n### Index Strategy\n\nIndexes are created for frequently queried columns:\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts\nimport { index } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';\n\nexport const agentsIndexes = {\n  statusIdx: index('agents_status_idx').on(agents.status),\n  accountIdx: index('agents_account_idx').on(agents.accountId),\n  createdAtIdx: index('agents_created_at_idx').on(agents.createdAt),\n};\n\nexport const historyIndexes = {\n  agentIdx: index('history_agent_idx').on(history.agentId),\n  commandIdx: index('history_command_idx').on(history.command),\n  createdAtIdx: index('history_created_at_idx').on(history.createdAt),\n};\n\nexport const auditLogsIndexes = {\n  accountIdx: index('audit_logs_account_idx').on(auditLogs.accountId),\n  actionIdx: index('audit_logs_action_idx').on(auditLogs.action),\n  createdAtIdx: index('audit_logs_created_at_idx').on(auditLogs.createdAt),\n};\n```\n\n### Drizzle-kit for Migrations\n\n```typescript\n// drizzle.config.ts\nimport type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';\n\nexport default {\n  schema: './apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts',\n  out: './apps/gateway/src/db/migrations',\n  driver: 'bun-sqlite',\n  dbCredentials: {\n    url: './data/gateway.db',\n  },\n} satisfies Config;\n```\n\nMigration commands:\n- `bun drizzle-kit generate` - Generate migration from schema changes\n- `bun drizzle-kit migrate` - Apply pending migrations\n- `bun drizzle-kit push` - Push schema directly (dev only)\n\n### WAL Mode Configuration\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/db/connection.ts\nimport { Database } from 'bun:sqlite';\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite';\n\nconst sqlite = new Database('./data/gateway.db');\nsqlite.exec('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL');\nsqlite.exec('PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL');\nsqlite.exec('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');\n\nexport const db = drizzle(sqlite);\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n```\napps/gateway/src/db/\n├── schema.ts            # Table definitions\n├── indexes.ts           # Index definitions\n├── connection.ts        # Database connection setup\n├── migrations/          # Generated migrations\n│   ├── 0000_initial.sql\n│   ├── 0001_add_dcg_tables.sql\n│   └── meta/\n└── queries/\n    ├── agents.ts        # Agent-related queries\n    ├── checkpoints.ts   # Checkpoint queries\n    ├── accounts.ts      # Account queries\n    └── audit.ts         # Audit log queries\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n\n- [ ] Schema validation tests\n  -

The project goals include:\n\n- **BYOA (Bring Your Own Accounts):** Users can connect their own provider accounts (Anthropic/OpenAI/etc).\n- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys):** Users can supply API keys (and rotate them) without leaking secrets into logs, artifacts, or UI.\n\nThis issue existed to ensure our CAAM auth management (storage, APIs, UI flows, logging, and test coverage) aligns with those goals and the overall safety posture of Flywheel Gateway.\n\n## What This Task Covered\n\n1. **Auth material handling model**\n   - Define what “auth material” is (API keys, OAuth tokens, refresh tokens, device-code sessions, etc.).\n   - Establish how auth material is stored and referenced (indirection via an internal secret reference, never direct echo in responses).\n\n2. **Rotation as a first-class workflow**\n   - Model key/token rotation as an explicit operation with audit events.\n   - Ensure rotation does not silently break running agents; document expected behavior.\n\n3. **Logging and redaction requirements**\n   - Ensure request/response logs and test logs never contain secrets.\n   - Ensure structured logs include stable identifiers (`accountId`, `profileId`, `workspaceId`, `correlationId`).\n\n4. **User experience alignment**\n   - Clarify the intended UX: guided onboarding, explicit copy around persistence, and clear recovery guidance for common auth failures.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] CAAM auth flows are explicitly documented and aligned with BYOA/BYOK goals (what is stored, where, and how it is protected).\n- [ ] All auth material is treated as secret: never returned verbatim, never logged, and always redacted in artifacts.\n- [ ] Rotation is a supported workflow with clear semantics, auditability, and failure recovery guidance.\n- [ ] API surfaces and UI flows call out failure modes (revoked token, expired device code, missing scopes) and provide actionable recovery steps.\n- [ ] Follow-up gaps are captured as separate beads with clear scope.\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Secret redaction helper covers headers, payload fields, and nested JSON keys.\n- [ ] Rotation state machine: valid/invalid transitions and audit event emission.\n- [ ] CAAM connection health evaluation: maps provider errors to stable error codes.\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] CAAM auth lifecycle endpoints (create/update/rotate/test) validate inputs and never echo secrets.\n- [ ] Audit log entries exist for rotation and failed auth attempts.\n- [ ] Correlation IDs thread through CAAM requests and into audit events.\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Onboarding flow (mock provider): connect account → select profile → spawn agent using profile.\n- [ ] Failure flow: revoked/expired auth → UI shows recovery actions; no secrets leak in browser console or API logs.\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] All tests log `correlationId` and anonymized entity IDs; secrets are never logged.\n\n## Closure Notes\n\nThis issue is **closed**; remaining UX follow-ups were split into:\n\n- `flywheel_gateway-4ub`: CAAM auth UX follow-ups (device-code, import/upload guidance, BYOA onboarding copy)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T23:46:20.778720353-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T02:59:27.249084582-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T10:49:50.513289968-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented CAAM auth management updates and synced docs"}
{"id":"flywheel_gateway-6wp","title":"FEAT: Agent Performance Analytics","description":"## Background\n\nUnderstanding individual agent performance is critical for optimizing the Flywheel ecosystem. Organizations need visibility into which agents are most productive, which models perform best for specific task types, and where bottlenecks exist. This bead implements comprehensive agent performance analytics with AI-powered recommendations to help operators continuously improve their agent fleet.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nAgent performance analytics serves multiple stakeholders:\n- **Operators**: Identify underperforming agents, optimize configurations\n- **Efficiency**: Understand usage drivers and optimize model selection\n- **Engineering**: Debug issues, improve agent prompts and tooling\n- **Management**: Track ROI, make informed scaling decisions\n\nThe analytics must go beyond simple metrics to provide actionable insights. This means:\n- Aggregating raw events into meaningful KPIs\n- Comparing performance across dimensions (model, task type, time)\n- Detecting anomalies and trends automatically\n- Generating human-readable recommendations\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Productivity Metrics\n\n**Tasks Completed:**\n- Count of tasks reaching terminal state (completed, failed, cancelled)\n- Breakdown by outcome: success vs failure vs timeout\n- Rolling averages: hourly, daily, weekly\n- Comparison to fleet average and historical self\n\n**Success Rate:**\n```typescript\ninterface SuccessRateMetric {\n  agent_id: string;\n  period: '1h' | '24h' | '7d' | '30d';\n  total_tasks: number;\n  successful_tasks: number;\n  success_rate: number;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-76h","title":"FEAT: Supervisor \u0026 Daemon Management","description":"## Overview\n\nFlywheel Gateway depends on several local background services (e.g., Agent Mail MCP server, cm, and bd’s daemon mode). This feature adds a **Supervisor** that can start/stop/restart these daemons, surface their health/logs, and emit real-time WebSocket events so the UI can show system readiness and failures.\n\nThis is primarily a **DX + reliability** feature: it reduces “why is nothing working?” time by making dependencies observable and recoverable from the Gateway itself.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nFlywheel Gateway is an orchestration hub. If prerequisite daemons aren’t running (or crash mid-session), downstream features fail in confusing ways. A first-class Supervisor provides:\n\n- Explicit status/health of required daemons\n- Automatic restarts under a clear policy\n- Log access for diagnosis\n- Real-time UI visibility via WebSocket events\n\n## Scope \u0026 Requirements\n\n### Supervisor Service (from `docs/PLAN.md` §5)\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/services/supervisor.service.ts\n\ninterface DaemonSpec {\n  name: string;\n  command: string[];\n  port?: number;\n  healthEndpoint?: string;\n  restartPolicy: 'always' | 'on-failure' | 'never';\n  maxRestarts: number;\n  restartDelayMs: number;\n}\n\nconst DEFAULT_SPECS: DaemonSpec[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'agent-mail',\n    command: ['mcp-agent-mail', 'serve'],\n    port: 8765,\n    healthEndpoint: '/health',\n    restartPolicy: 'always',\n    maxRestarts: 5,\n    restartDelayMs: 1000,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'cm-server',\n    command: ['cm', 'serve'],\n    port: 8766,\n    healthEndpoint: '/health',\n    restartPolicy: 'always',\n    maxRestarts: 5,\n    restartDelayMs: 1000,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'bd-daemon',\n    command: ['bd', 'daemon'],\n    restartPolicy: 'on-failure',\n    maxRestarts: 3,\n    restartDelayMs: 2000,\n  },\n];\n\ninterface DaemonState {\n  name: string;\n  status: 'starting' | 'running' | 'stopping' | 'stopped' | 'failed';\n  pid?: number;\n  port?: number;\n  startedAt?: Date;\n  restartCount: number;\n  lastHealthCheck?: Date;\n  lastError?: string;\n}\n\nexport class SupervisorService {\n  private daemons = new Map\u003cstring, DaemonState\u003e();\n  private processes = new Map\u003cstring, Subprocess\u003e();\n\n  async startAll(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    for (const spec of DEFAULT_SPECS) {\n      await this.startDaemon(spec);\n    }\n  }\n\n  async startDaemon(spec: DaemonSpec): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    const proc = Bun.spawn(spec.command, {\n      stdout: 'pipe',\n      stderr: 'pipe',\n      onExit: (proc, exitCode) =\u003e this.handleExit(spec, exitCode),\n    });\n\n    this.processes.set(spec.name, proc);\n    this.daemons.set(spec.name, {\n      name: spec.name,\n      status: 'starting',\n      pid: proc.pid,\n      port: spec.port,\n      startedAt: new Date(),\n      restartCount: 0,\n    });\n\n    // Start health check loop\n    if (spec.healthEndpoint) {\n      this.startHealthCheck(spec);\n    }\n  }\n\n  async stopDaemon(name: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    const proc = this.processes.get(name);\n    if (proc) {\n      proc.kill();\n      this.daemons.set(name, { ...this.daemons.get(name)!, status: 'stopped' });\n    }\n  }\n\n  async getStatus(): Promise\u003cDaemonState[]\u003e {\n    return Array.from(this.daemons.values());\n  }\n\n  private async handleExit(spec: DaemonSpec, exitCode: number | null): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    const state = this.daemons.get(spec.name)!;\n\n    if (\n      spec.restartPolicy === 'always' ||\n      (spec.restartPolicy === 'on-failure' \u0026\u0026 exitCode !== 0)\n    ) {\n      if (state.restartCount \u003c spec.maxRestarts) {\n        state.restartCount++;\n        state.status = 'starting';\n        await Bun.sleep(spec.restartDelayMs);\n        await this.startDaemon(spec);\n      } else {\n        state.status = 'failed';\n        state.lastError = `Max restarts (${spec.maxRestarts}) exceeded`;\n        this.emitEvent('daemon.failed', state);\n      }\n    } else {\n      state.status = 'stopped';\n    }\n  }\n\n  private startHealthCheck(spec: DaemonSpec): void {\n    setInterval(async () =\u003e {\n      try {\n        const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:${spec.port}${spec.healthEndpoint}`);\n        const state = this.daemons.get(spec.name)!;\n        if (res.ok \u0026\u0026 state.status === 'starting') {\n          state.status = 'running';\n          this.emitEvent('daemon.started', state);\n        }\n        state.lastHealthCheck = new Date();\n      } catch {\n        // Health check failed -

logging\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. All API operations generate audit events automatically\n2. Correlation IDs propagate across all service calls\n3. Sensitive data is redacted according to configuration\n4. Export supports CSV and JSON formats with compression\n5. Retention policies can be configured per-category\n6. Search returns results within 2 seconds for 30-day queries\n7. ClickHouse receives audit events within 5 seconds\n8. Audit events are tamper-evident (cannot be modified after creation)\n9. Export jobs handle datasets up to 1M records\n10. UI provides intuitive search and filter interface\n11. Compliance report generation for SOC 2 audits\n12. Performance: \u003c 5ms overhead per request for audit logging\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests for redaction service\n- Integration tests for correlation propagation\n- Load tests for high-volume audit logging\n- E2E tests for export functionality\n- Compliance tests for required audit fields\n\n## Reference\n\nPLAN.md section 24 - Audit Trail Hardening\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Redaction rules remove secrets deterministically and preserve non-sensitive context\n- [ ] Export formats (JSON/NDJSON) are schema-valid and stable across versions\n- [ ] Retention policies apply correctly without deleting required audit records\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Mutating operations create audit events with correlation IDs and can be queried via REST\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Export under load does not block core operations; partial failures return resumable job state\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + auditEventId + actor + entity; exported content is not logged\n\n","notes":"## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] AuditEvent: creates with all fields\n- [ ] AuditEvent: generates correlation ID\n- [ ] AuditEvent: serializes for storage\n- [ ] TamperDetection: computes hash chain\n- [ ] TamperDetection: verifies integrity\n- [ ] Export: formats as CSV\n- [ ] Export: formats as JSON\n- [ ] Retention: applies policy rules\n- [ ] Retention: archives old events\n- [ ] Search: full-text indexing\n- [ ] Search: filter by actor/resource\n- [ ] Redaction: sanitizes sensitive data\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Events persisted on API calls\n- [ ] Correlation ID flows through stack\n- [ ] Export generates valid file\n- [ ] Retention deletes expired events\n- [ ] Search returns matching events\n- [ ] Hash chain valid across events\n- [ ] Large export handled streaming\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] User action appears in audit log\n- [ ] Export downloaded in UI\n- [ ] Search finds historical event\n- [ ] Tamper detection alerts on mismatch\n\n### Performance Tests\n- [ ] Event logging \u003c5ms overhead\n- [ ] Search \u003c500ms for 1M events\n- [ ] Export 10k events \u003c10s\n- [ ] Retention cleanup efficient\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Storage full: graceful handling\n- [ ] Corrupt event: isolated and flagged\n- [ ] Export timeout: partial file\n- [ ] Hash mismatch: alert and quarantine","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T13:59:36.299921252-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-08T20:49:34.93065896-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-7ek","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-d18","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T14:01:52.556581277-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
{"id":"flywheel_gateway-7n4","title":"Job Orchestration for Long-Running Operations","description":"## Background\n\nThe Job Orchestration system provides infrastructure for managing long-running operations that cannot complete within typical HTTP request timeouts. This includes context builds, codebase scans, exports, and other operations that may take seconds to minutes.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **User Experience**: Long-running operations need progress feedback. Users should see what is happening, not a spinning cursor.\n\n2. **Reliability**: Operations that span minutes need checkpointing and resume capability. Network blips should not require restart.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: Concurrent long operations need throttling. Unbounded parallelism leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n4. **Cancellation**: Users must be able to cancel operations. Runaway jobs waste resources and block progress.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Job Types\n\n```typescript\nenum JobType {\n  // Context operations\n  CONTEXT_BUILD = 'context_build',\n

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-bqs","title":"DCG Advanced Features","description":"## Overview\n\nDCG (Dangerous Command Guard) Advanced Features extends the core content safety system with administrative capabilities, feedback mechanisms, and analytics. This enables operators to fine-tune content filtering behavior and track safety metrics.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nThe base DCG implementation provides essential content filtering, but production deployments require:\n\n- Administrative control over allowlists and blocklists\n- Feedback loops to reduce false positives\n- Visibility into block statistics and patterns\n- Integration with CM (Claude Mind) for pattern learning\n\nThese advanced features transform DCG from a static filter into an adaptive safety system.\n\n## Feature Components\n\n### 1. Allowlist Management UI\n\nAdministrators need to manage exceptions for legitimate content that triggers false positives:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AllowlistEntry {\n  id: string;\n  pattern: string;           // Regex or exact match\n  matchType: 'exact' | 'regex' | 'contains';\n  scope: 'global' | 'repository' | 'agent';\n  scopeId?: string;          // Repository or agent ID if scoped\n  reason: string;            // Why this is allowed\n  createdBy: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;          // Optional expiration\n  usageCount: number;        // How often this rule matched\n}\n\ninterface AllowlistService {\n  addEntry(entry: CreateAllowlistEntry): Promise\u003cAllowlistEntry\u003e;\n  removeEntry(id: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  updateEntry(id: string, updates: Partial\u003cAllowlistEntry\u003e): Promise\u003cAllowlistEntry\u003e;\n  listEntries(scope?: AllowlistScope): Promise\u003cAllowlistEntry[]\u003e;\n  checkContent(content: string, context: ContentContext): Promise\u003cAllowlistMatch | null\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. False Positive Feedback Loop\n\nWhen content is incorrectly blocked, users can submit feedback:\n\n```typescript\ninterface FalsePositiveFeedback {\n  id: string;\n  blockedContent: string;      // The content that was blocked\n  blockReason: string;         // Which rule triggered the block\n  packId: string;              // Which pack contained the rule\n  submittedBy: string;\n  submittedAt: Date;\n  status: 'pending' | 'reviewed' | 'accepted' | 'rejected';\n  reviewedBy?: string;\n  reviewedAt?: Date;\n  resolution?: 'allowlisted' | 'rule-modified' | 'no-action';\n  notes?: string;\n}\n\ninterface FeedbackWorkflow {\n  submitFeedback(feedback: CreateFeedback): Promise\u003cFalsePositiveFeedback\u003e;\n  reviewFeedback(id: string, decision: FeedbackDecision): Promise\u003cFalsePositiveFeedback\u003e;\n  getPendingFeedback(): Promise\u003cFalsePositiveFeedback[]\u003e;\n  getFeedbackStats(): Promise\u003cFeedbackStats\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Pack Enable/Disable Configuration\n\nDCG rules are organized into packs that can be individually enabled or disabled:\n\n```typescript\ninterface DCGPack {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  version: string;\n  ruleCount: number;\n  enabled: boolean;\n  priority: number;          // Higher priority packs evaluated first\n  scope: 'system' | 'organization' | 'repository';\n}\n\ninterface PackConfiguration {\n  enablePack(packId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  disablePack(packId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  setPriority(packId: string, priority: number): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  getPackStatus(): Promise\u003cDCGPack[]\u003e;\n  reloadPacks(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Block Statistics Dashboard\n\nReal-time visibility into DCG activity:\n\n```typescript\ninterface BlockStatistics {\n  totalBlocks: number;\n  blocksToday: number;\n  blocksByPack: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e;\n  blocksByRule: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e;\n  blocksByAgent: Record\u003cstring, number\u003e;\n  blocksByHour: TimeSeriesData;\n  topBlockedPatterns: PatternStat[];\n  falsePositiveRate: number;\n}\n\ninterface StatisticsService {\n  getStatistics(timeRange: TimeRange): Promise\u003cBlockStatistics\u003e;\n  getBlockHistory(filters: BlockFilters): Promise\u003cBlockEvent[]\u003e;\n  exportStatistics(format: 'csv' | 'json'): Promise\u003cstring\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. CM Integration for Pattern Learning\n\nIntegration with Claude Mind enables the safety system to learn from patterns:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CMPatternLearning {\n  // Report patterns to CM for analysis\n  reportPattern(pattern: PatternReport): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  // Request pattern classification from CM\n  classifyContent(content: string): Promise\u003cContentClassification\u003e;\n  \n  // Get suggested rules from CM analysis\n  getSuggestedRules(): Promise\u003cSuggestedRule[]\u003e;\n  \n  // Apply CM-suggested rule with human approval\n  applySuggestedRule(ruleId: string, approver: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface PatternReport {\n  content: string;\n  wasBlocked: boolean;\n  wasFalsePositive: boolean;\n  context: ContentContext;\n}\n\ninterface ContentClassification {\n  category: 'safe' | 'suspicious' | 'dangerous';\n  confidence: number;\n  reasoning: string;\n  suggestedAction: 'allow' | 'block' | 'review';\n}\n```\n\n## Frontend Components\n\n### DCGDashboard.tsx\nMain dashboard showing:\n- Overall safety metrics\n- Block activity chart\n- Pack status overview\n- Quick actions\n\n### AllowlistManager.tsx\n- List of allowlist entries with search/filter\n- Add/edit/delete entry forms\n- Scope selection (global, repo, agent)\n- Usage statistics per entry\n\n### FeedbackQueue.tsx\n- Pending feedback review queue\n- Feedback detail view\n- Decision interface (accept/reject)\n- Resolution actions\n\n### PackConfigurator.tsx\n- Pack list with enable/disable toggles\n- Priority ordering (drag-and-drop)\n- Pack details and rule preview\n- Reload functionality\n\n### BlockStatisticsChart.tsx\n- Time series visualization of blocks\n- Breakdown by pack, rule, agent\n- Trend analysis\n- Export controls\n\n## File Locations\n\n- `apps/gateway/src/dcg/allowlist.service.ts` -

Input Validation \u0026 Sanitization\n\n```typescript\n// Central validation middleware\ninterface ValidationConfig {\n  maxRequestBodySize: number;      // Default: 1MB\n  maxUrlLength: number;            // Default: 2048\n  maxHeaderSize: number;           // Default: 8KB\n  allowedContentTypes: string[];   // ['application/json']\n  sanitizeHtml: boolean;           // Strip HTML from inputs\n  validateUnicode: boolean;        // Reject invalid sequences\n}\n\n// Zod schemas for all inputs with explicit constraints\nconst AgentIdSchema = z.string()\n  .min(1)\n  .max(64)\n  .regex(/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/, 'Invalid agent ID format');\n\nconst PathSchema = z.string()\n  .max(1024)\n  .refine(path =\u003e \\!path.includes('..'), 'Path traversal not allowed')\n  .refine(path =\u003e \\!path.startsWith('/'), 'Absolute paths not allowed');\n```\n\n### 2. Authentication \u0026 Authorization\n\n```typescript\n// JWT configuration\ninterface AuthConfig {\n  algorithm: 'RS256';              // Asymmetric for key rotation\n  issuer: string;\n  audience: string[];\n  tokenExpiry: number;             // 1 hour\n  refreshExpiry: number;           // 7 days\n  maxSessionAge: number;           // 24 hours\n}\n\n// RBAC permissions\ntype Permission = \n  | 'agent:read' | 'agent:write' | 'agent:admin'\n  | 'bead:read' | 'bead:write' | 'bead:admin'\n  | 'settings:read' | 'settings:write'\n  | 'audit:read' | 'audit:export';\n\ninterface Role {\n  name: string;\n  permissions: Permission[];\n  inherits?: string[];\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Secret Management\n\n```typescript\n// Secret handling rules\ninterface SecretConfig {\n  // Storage: encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM\n  encryptionKey: string;           // From environment variable\n  \n  // Rotation\n  keyRotationDays: number;         // Auto-rotate every 90 days\n  \n  // Access logging\n  logSecretAccess: boolean;        // Audit trail for secret reads\n  \n  // Redaction patterns for logs\n  redactionPatterns: RegExp[];\n}\n\n// Never log these patterns\nconst REDACT_PATTERNS = [\n  /Bearer\\s+[A-Za-z0-9\\-._~+\\/]+=*/g,   // JWT tokens\n  /sk_[a-zA-Z0-9]{32,}/g,                  // API keys\n  /password[\"']?\\s*[:=]\\s*[\"']?[^\"'\\s]+/gi,  // Passwords\n  /secret[\"']?\\s*[:=]\\s*[\"']?[^\"'\\s]+/gi,    // Secrets\n];\n```\n\n### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)\n\n```typescript\n// CSP headers for web UI\nconst cspPolicy = {\n  'default-src': [\"'self'\"],\n  'script-src': [\"'self'\", \"'wasm-unsafe-eval'\"],  // For WebAssembly\n  'style-src': [\"'self'\", \"'unsafe-inline'\"],      // For Tailwind\n  'img-src': [\"'self'\", 'data:', 'blob:'],\n  'connect-src': [\"'self'\", 'wss:', 'https:'],      // WebSocket + API\n  'frame-ancestors': [\"'none'\"],                    // Clickjacking protection\n  'form-action': [\"'self'\"],\n  'base-uri': [\"'self'\"],\n};\n\n// Additional security headers\nconst securityHeaders = {\n  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',\n  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',\n  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',\n  'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',\n  'Permissions-Policy': 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()',\n};\n```\n\n### 5. Rate Limiting \u0026 DDoS Protection\n\n```typescript\ninterface RateLimitConfig {\n  // Per-workspace limits\n  requestsPerMinute: number;       // Default: 1000\n  wsConnectionsPerUser: number;    // Default: 5\n  \n  // Per-endpoint limits (override)\n  endpoints: {\n    'POST /agents': { rpm: 10 };   // Expensive operation\n    'GET /agents': { rpm: 100 };   // Read-heavy\n  };\n  \n  // Burst handling\n  burstAllowance: number;          // 10% over limit\n  \n  // Response headers\n  includeHeaders: boolean;         // X-RateLimit-*\n}\n```\n\n### 6. Secure Defaults\n\n- HTTPS enforced (redirect HTTP)\n- CORS restricted to known origins\n- Cookie flags: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict\n- Session timeout: 24 hours inactive\n- Password policy: minimum 12 chars, complexity required\n- MFA: supported, recommended for admin users\n\n## File Locations\n\n| Component | Path |\n|-----------|------|\n| Auth middleware | `apps/gateway/src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` |\n| RBAC service | `apps/gateway/src/services/rbac.service.ts` |\n| Validation middleware | `apps/gateway/src/middleware/validation.middleware.ts` |\n| Security headers | `apps/gateway/src/middleware/security-headers.middleware.ts` |\n| Rate limiter | `apps/gateway/src/middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts` |\n| Secret service | `apps/gateway/src/services/secret.service.ts` |\n| Security types | `packages/shared/src/types/security.types.ts` |\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Input validation rejects malformed data\n- [ ] Path traversal attempts blocked\n- [ ] JWT validation handles edge cases (expired, malformed, wrong algorithm)\n- [ ] RBAC permission checks are correct\n- [ ] Secret redaction removes all sensitive patterns\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Auth flow end-to-end (login -\u003e token -\u003e refresh -\u003e logout)\n- [ ] Rate limiting enforced across requests\n- [ ] CORS headers correct for allowed/blocked origins\n- [ ] CSP headers present on all responses\n\n### Security Tests\n- [ ] SQL injection attempts blocked\n- [ ] XSS payloads sanitized\n- [ ] CSRF tokens required for state-changing requests\n- [ ] Session fixation prevented\n- [ ] Secrets never appear in logs\n\n### Penetration Test Scenarios\n- [ ] Auth bypass attempts\n- [ ] Privilege escalation attempts\n- [ ] Token replay attacks\n- [ ] Rate limit bypass attempts\n\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Web UI + API authZ: read-only role cannot perform write/admin actions; receives 403 with safe error envelope and actionable UI.\n- [ ] WebSocket authZ: unauthorized subscribe rejected; no data leaked (including replay buffers).\n- [ ] Browser security: CSP blocks inline script injection; CORS blocks disallowed origins while allowing configured origins.\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Security test runs log correlationId + anonymized actor/workspace IDs and assert redaction (no secrets).\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All inputs validated with Zod schemas\n- [ ] JWT auth with RS256 algorithm implemented\n- [ ] RBAC with role inheritance working\n- [ ] CSP headers on all responses\n- [ ] Rate limiting with X-RateLimit headers\n- [ ] Secrets encrypted at rest\n- [ ] Secrets never logged (verified by grep)\n- [ ] Security headers on all responses\n- [ ] HTTPS enforced in production\n- [ ] Cookie flags correctly set\n- [ ] Penetration test checklist passed\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md §24 - Security \u0026 Audit\n- OWASP Top 10 2023\n- OWASP API Security Top 10\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-09T01:22:56.683143506-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T03:07:56.157141552-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-bz1","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-41h","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-09T01:23:02.785190111-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-bz1","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-09T01:23:02.815994369-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-c6q","title":"FEAT: Real-Time Agent Collaboration Graph","description":"## Overview\n\nInteractive visualization showing agent coordination in real-time. The Collaboration Graph provides a dynamic, force-directed graph view of all active agents, their resource reservations, and inter-agent communication patterns within a session.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nAs multi-agent systems grow in complexity, understanding coordination dynamics becomes critical. Operators frequently ask:\n\n- **\"Why is this agent waiting?\"** - Visualize blocking dependencies and resource contention\n- **\"Who has file X?\"** - Instantly see reservation ownership across the agent pool\n- **\"What's the communication flow?\"** - Trace message paths and handoff sequences\n- **\"Where are the bottlenecks?\"** - Identify coordination hotspots and deadlock risks\n\nWithout visibility into agent coordination, debugging multi-agent workflows becomes guesswork. The Collaboration Graph transforms abstract coordination state into intuitive visual patterns.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Graph Data Model\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentNode {\n  id: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  status: 'active' | 'idle' | 'waiting' | 'blocked';\n  currentTask?: string;\n  reservationCount: number;\n  messagesSent: number;\n  messagesReceived: number;\n}\n\ninterface ReservationNode {\n  id: string;\n  resourcePath: string;\n  resourceType: 'file' | 'directory' | 'lock';\n  holderId: string;\n  waiters: string[];\n  acquiredAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface ConflictNode {\n  id: string;\n  conflictType: 'deadlock' | 'contention' | 'timeout';\n  involvedAgents: string[];\n  involvedResources: string[];\n  severity: 'warning' | 'critical';\n  detectedAt: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Edge Types\n\n| Edge Type | Description | Visual Style |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| `message` | Agent-to-agent communication | Animated dashed line, directional arrow |\n| `handoff` | Task delegation between agents | Thick solid line, pulse animation |\n| `dependency` | Blocking relationship (waiting for resource) | Red dotted line when blocked |\n| `reservation` | Agent owns resource | Green solid line to reservation node |\n| `waiting` | Agent waiting for resource | Orange dashed line to reservation node |\n\n### Real-Time Updates\n\n```typescript\n// WebSocket subscription for graph updates\nconst subscriptions = {\n  'agent.status': updateAgentNode,\n  'reservation.acquired': addReservationEdge,\n  'reservation.released': removeReservationEdge,\n  'message.sent': animateMessageEdge,\n  'conflict.detected': highlightConflictNode,\n  'conflict.resolved': removeConflictNode,\n};\n```\n\nUpdates are batched at 100ms intervals to prevent UI thrashing during high-activity periods.\n\n### View Modes\n\n| Mode | Shows | Use Case |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| **Agents Only** | Agent nodes + message/handoff edges | Communication flow analysis |\n| **Files** | Agent nodes + reservation nodes + ownership edges | Resource contention debugging |\n| **Full** | All nodes + all edges | Complete system state |\n\n### Layout Algorithm\n\n- **Base**: Force-directed layout using D3-force\n- **Clustering**: Semantic grouping by active task similarity\n- **Collision**: Node repulsion prevents overlap\n- **Centering**: Active/blocked agents pulled toward center\n- **Stabilization**: Layout settles within 500ms of changes\n\n## Key Components\n\n```\napps/web/src/components/collaboration/\n├── CollaborationGraph.tsx       # Main container, manages state \u0026 subscriptions\n├── nodes/\n│   ├── AgentGraphNode.tsx       # Agent visualization with status indicators\n│   ├── ReservationGraphNode.tsx # Resource node with holder/waiter counts\n│   └── ConflictGraphNode.tsx    # Conflict alert with severity styling\n├── edges/\n│   ├── MessageEdge.tsx          # Animated message flow visualization\n│   ├── HandoffEdge.tsx          # Task delegation indicator\n│   └── DependencyEdge.tsx       # Blocking relationship with state color\n├── controls/\n│   ├── ViewModeSelector.tsx     # Toggle between view modes\n│   ├── GraphLegend.tsx          # Visual key for node/edge types\n│   └── GraphStats.tsx           # Real-time metrics panel\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── useGraphSubscription.ts  # WebSocket subscription management\n│   ├── useGraphLayout.ts        # D3-force layout integration\n│   └── useGraphSelection.ts     # Node/edge selection state\n└── utils/\n    ├── graphTransforms.ts       # API data to React Flow format\n    └── layoutConfig.ts          # D3-force parameters\n```\n\n## Technology\n\n- **React Flow** (`@xyflow/react`) -

Without structured logging and correlation IDs, debugging distributed request flows becomes nearly impossible. The audit pipeline provides compliance capabilities and operational insights.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n### Why Structured JSON Logging?\n- **Machine Parseable**: JSON logs can be ingested by log aggregation systems (ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch)\n- **Consistent Schema**: All log entries follow a predictable format with timestamp, level, service, message, and metadata\n- **Queryable**: Enables powerful filtering and analysis across all system components\n- **Production Ready**: Essential for SRE workflows and incident response\n\n### Why Correlation IDs?\n- **Request Tracing**: Track a single user request through gateway, agent service, and all downstream components\n- **Debugging**: When something fails, find all related log entries instantly\n- **Performance Analysis**: Measure latency across the full request lifecycle\n- **multi-workspace Safety**: Ensure logs can be filtered per-workspace for support inquiries\n\n### Why Audit Pipeline?\n- **Compliance**: Many advanced customers require audit trails for agent actions\n- **Security**: Detect and investigate suspicious activity patterns\n- **Analytics**: Understand system usage patterns and optimize accordingly\n- **Accountability**: Track which user/API key triggered which agent operations\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Logging Implementation\n- Use `pino` for high-performance JSON logging (10x faster than winston)\n- Configure log levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal\n- Default to `info` in production, `debug` in development\n- Implement log rotation and size limits for local development\n- Redact sensitive fields: API keys, tokens, passwords, PII\n\n### Correlation ID Strategy\n- Generate UUID v7 (time-ordered) for new requests at gateway entry\n- Accept incoming `X-Correlation-ID` header to support distributed tracing\n- Propagate via AsyncLocalStorage for automatic inclusion in all logs\n- Include in all HTTP responses for client-side correlation\n- Pass to spawned agents via environment variable\n\n### Audit Event Schema\n```typescript\ninterface AuditEvent {\n  id: string;                    // UUID v7\n  timestamp: string;             // ISO 8601\n  correlationId: string;         // Request correlation\n  workspaceId: string;              // multi-workspace isolation\n  userId?: string;               // Authenticated user\n  apiKeyId?: string;             // API key used\n  action: AuditAction;           // Enum of auditable actions\n  resource: string;              // Resource identifier\n  resourceType: ResourceType;    // agent, session, output, etc.\n  outcome: 'success' | 'failure';\n  metadata: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e;\n  ipAddress?: string;            // For security analysis\n  userAgent?: string;            // Client identification\n}\n```\n\n### Sensitive Data Redaction\n- API keys: Show only last 4 characters\n- Passwords: Replace entirely with `[REDACTED]`\n- Email addresses: Partial redaction `j***@example.com`\n- Custom redaction rules via configuration\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All HTTP requests receive correlation ID (generated or propagated)\n- [ ] All log entries include: timestamp, level, correlationId, service, message\n- [ ] Sensitive fields are automatically redacted in logs\n- [ ] Log level is configurable via environment variable\n- [ ] Audit events are emitted for: agent spawn, agent terminate, session create, authentication\n- [ ] Audit events are written to both log stream and audit table\n- [ ] Correlation ID appears in HTTP response headers\n- [ ] AsyncLocalStorage correctly propagates context through async operations\n- [ ] Unit tests for redaction logic with edge cases\n- [ ] Integration test for correlation ID propagation\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Middleware\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/correlation.middleware.ts` - Correlation ID generation/propagation\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/logging.middleware.ts` - Request/response logging\n\n### Services\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/audit.service.ts` - Audit event creation and persistence\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/logger.service.ts` - Configured pino logger instance\n\n### Utilities\n- `apps/gateway/src/utils/redaction.ts` - Sensitive data redaction functions\n- `apps/gateway/src/utils/async-context.ts` - AsyncLocalStorage helpers\n\n### Configuration\n- `apps/gateway/src/config/logging.config.ts` - Log levels, formats, destinations\n\n### Types\n- `packages/shared-types/src/audit.types.ts` - Audit event interfaces and enums\n\n## Reference\n\n- PLAN.md §24: Observability and Logging\n- OpenTelemetry Logging Data Model for schema inspiration\n- OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet for security considerations\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Correlation ID generation/propagation across middleware, services, and WS events\n- [ ] Redaction utilities remove secrets deterministically\n- [ ] Audit event builder produces schema-valid events with required metadata\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] REST request with correlation header → response + logs include same correlationId\n- [ ] WS event emission includes correlationId and matches event schema\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Logging backend unavailable → non-fatal fallback without dropping requests\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Tests assert logs are structured JSON and contain expected keys (no console.log noise)\n\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T13:31:55.959839309-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T20:13:24.561950292-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T20:13:24.561950292-05:00","close_reason":"Implementation complete - all components implemented and tested","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-d18","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-ls4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-08T14:01:51.33497195-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

When missing, the system must degrade gracefully with actionable guidance.\n\n## Utility Management (PLAN.md §17.7.1)\n\n### Data Model\n\n```ts\n// packages/shared/src/types/utilities.ts\n\nexport interface DeveloperUtility {\n  name: string;           // \"giil\" | \"csctf\"\n  description: string;\n  version: string;        // desired/known-good\n  installCommand: string; // one-liner install\n  checkCommand: string;   // verify installation\n  installed: boolean;\n  installedVersion?: string;\n  lastCheckedAt?: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Known Utilities\n\n```ts\nconst UTILITIES: DeveloperUtility[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'giil',\n    description: 'Download cloud photos for AI visual analysis',\n    version: '3.1.0',\n    installCommand: 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/giil/main/install.sh | bash',\n    checkCommand: 'giil --version',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'csctf',\n    description: 'Convert AI chat share links to Markdown/HTML',\n    version: '0.4.5',\n    installCommand: 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/chat_shared_conversation_to_file/main/install.sh | bash',\n    checkCommand: 'csctf --version',\n  },\n];\n```\n\n## REST API Endpoints (PLAN.md §17.7.2)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/utilities` | List all utilities with install status |\n| `POST` | `/utilities/{name}/install` | Install a utility |\n| `POST` | `/utilities/{name}/update` | Update a utility |\n| `GET` | `/utilities/doctor` | Check all utilities health |\n\n## giil Integration (PLAN.md §17.7.3)\n\ngiil enables agents (and humans) to pull screenshots/images from cloud share links into a local artifact that can be attached to agent context or used for debugging UI.\n\n```ts\ninterface GiilRequest {\n  url: string; // iCloud/Dropbox/Google share URL\n  outputDir?: string;\n  format?: 'file' | 'json' | 'base64';\n}\n\ninterface GiilResponse {\n  success: boolean;\n  path?: string;\n  width?: number;\n  height?: number;\n  captureMethod?: 'download' | 'cdn' | 'element' | 'viewport';\n  error?: string;\n}\n```\n\n## csctf Integration (PLAN.md §17.7.4)\n\ncsctf enables archiving AI conversations for knowledge management, documentation, and downstream indexing into CASS.\n\n```ts\ninterface CsctfRequest {\n  url: string; // ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok/Claude share URL\n  outputDir?: string;\n  formats?: ('md' | 'html')[];\n  publishToGhPages?: boolean;\n}\n\ninterface CsctfResponse {\n  success: boolean;\n  markdownPath?: string;\n  htmlPath?: string;\n  title?: string;\n  messageCount?: number;\n  error?: string;\n}\n```\n\n## UX Requirements\n\n- Utilities page shows installed/missing status, version, and a single “Doctor” button.\n- Missing utilities show copy-paste install command (and optional one-click install if configured).\n- Running giil/csctf from the UI shows progress, captures stdout/stderr, and stores a small artifact summary.\n\n## Safety / Security Requirements\n\n- Never log full share URLs or OAuth tokens.

It leverages tmux for PTY management and session isolation.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nWhile native agent drivers (Claude Code SDK, API-based) offer superior integration, some scenarios require terminal-based execution:\n\n- Legacy agent tools without API support\n- Debugging and development workflows\n- Environments where native drivers fail\n- Manual intervention capabilities\n\nTmux provides robust session management with:\n- Detached execution (survives driver disconnect)\n- Full PTY support (handles interactive prompts)\n- Session capture (complete output history)\n- Scriptable control interface\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### AgentDriver Interface Compliance\n\nThe Tmux driver implements the standard AgentDriver interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  type: 'native' | 'api' | 'terminal';\n  \n  initialize(config: DriverConfig): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  start(agent: Agent, task: Task): Promise\u003cAgentSession\u003e;\n  stop(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  sendInput(sessionId: string, input: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  getOutput(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cOutputChunk[]\u003e;\n  getStatus(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cSessionStatus\u003e;\n  cleanup(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### TmuxAgentDriver Implementation\n\n```typescript\nclass TmuxAgentDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly id = 'tmux-driver';\n  readonly name = 'Tmux Terminal Driver';\n  readonly type = 'terminal';\n  \n  private sessions: Map\u003cstring, TmuxSession\u003e = new Map();\n  private tmuxSocketPath: string;\n  \n  async initialize(config: TmuxDriverConfig): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    // Verify tmux installation\n    // Create dedicated socket for isolation\n    // Set up output capture directory\n  }\n  \n  async start(agent: Agent, task: Task): Promise\u003cAgentSession\u003e {\n    // Create new tmux session with unique name\n    // Configure PTY dimensions\n    // Start agent command\n    // Begin output capture\n    // Return session handle\n  }\n  \n  async stop(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    // Send SIGTERM to session\n    // Wait for graceful shutdown\n    // Force kill if timeout\n    // Clean up session resources\n  }\n  \n  async sendInput(sessionId: string, input: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    // Send keys to tmux session\n    // Handle special characters\n    // Support escape sequences\n  }\n  \n  async getOutput(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cOutputChunk[]\u003e {\n    // Capture pane contents\n    // Parse into structured chunks\n    // Track output position\n    // Handle ANSI codes\n  }\n  \n  async getStatus(sessionId: string): Promise\u003cSessionStatus\u003e {\n    // Check if session exists\n    // Get running process info\n    // Calculate resource usage\n    // Return structured status\n  }\n  \n  async cleanup(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    // Kill all managed sessions\n    // Remove socket file\n    // Clean up capture directory\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### PTY Management\n\n```typescript\ninterface TmuxSession {\n  sessionName: string;\n  windowId: string;\n  paneId: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  lastActivity: Date;\n  outputFile: string;\n  outputPosition: number;\n  pid?: number;\n}\n\ninterface TmuxManager {\n  // Session lifecycle\n  createSession(name: string, command: string): Promise\u003cTmuxSession\u003e;\n  destroySession(name: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  listSessions(): Promise\u003cTmuxSession[]\u003e;\n  \n  // Input/Output\n  sendKeys(session: string, keys: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  capturePane(session: string, options: CaptureOptions): Promise\u003cstring\u003e;\n  \n  // Session management\n  hasSession(name: string): Promise\u003cboolean\u003e;\n  getSessionPid(name: string): Promise\u003cnumber | null\u003e;\n  resizePane(session: string, width: number, height: number): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Output Capture Strategy\n\nTwo complementary capture mechanisms:\n\n1. **Pipe Capture** (for real-time streaming)\n   ```bash\n   tmux pipe-pane -t $SESSION -o \"cat \u003e\u003e /path/to/output.log\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Pane Capture** (for complete history)\n   ```bash\n   tmux capture-pane -t $SESSION -p -S -

Rather than waiting for context overflow errors, this system maintains optimal context health through graduated interventions.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Proactive vs Reactive**: Waiting for context overflow means lost work and degraded agent performance. Proactive management prevents these issues entirely.\n\n2. **Seamless Experience**: Users and agents should never experience sudden context loss. Graduated interventions maintain continuity.\n\n3. **Cost Optimization**: Compaction and summarization reduce token usage while preserving essential information.\n\n4. **Agent Continuity**: When rotation is necessary, automatic context transfer ensures the new agent starts with full awareness.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Health Thresholds\n\n```typescript\ninterface ContextHealthThresholds {\n  // Warning level - start preparing\n  warning: {\n    percentage: 75;

The Metrics and Alerts System provides real-time visibility into Flywheel Gateway operations, enabling operators to track agent performance, detect issues early, and maintain system health.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nWithout proper observability, operators are blind to:\n- Agent performance degradation before users notice\n- Resource exhaustion approaching critical thresholds\n- Patterns indicating systemic issues\n- Cost trends that could lead to budget overruns\n\nThe Metrics system captures key indicators across all subsystems while the Alerts system provides configurable notifications based on thresholds and conditions.\n\n**Architecture Note:** Prometheus remains the **authoritative** source for real-time alerting and SLOs;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-i6c","title":"Custom Dashboard Builder","description":"## Background\n\nAs the Flywheel Gateway platform matures, users need the ability to create personalized views of their agent ecosystem, costs, and activity metrics. A custom dashboard builder enables users to construct tailored monitoring interfaces without requiring engineering intervention, democratizing data visualization across the organization.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, users are limited to predefined dashboard layouts that may not align with their specific monitoring needs. Different roles (developers, managers, finance) have distinct requirements for data visualization. Without customization capabilities, users either lack visibility into relevant metrics or must request engineering resources for custom reports.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Core Architecture\n\nThe dashboard builder will leverage react-grid-layout for drag-and-drop widget placement, providing a familiar interface similar to tools like Grafana or Datadog dashboards.\n\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/components/analytics/DashboardBuilder.tsx\ninterface Dashboard {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description?: string;\n  ownerId: string;\n  visibility: 'private' | 'team' | 'public';\n  teamId?: string;\n  layout: DashboardLayout;\n  widgets: Widget[];\n  refreshInterval: number; // seconds, 0 = manual only\n  createdAt: Date;\n  updatedAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface DashboardLayout {\n  columns: number; // typically 12 or 24\n  rowHeight: number;\n  margin: [number, number];\n  containerPadding: [number, number];\n}\n\ninterface Widget {\n  id: string;\n  type: WidgetType;\n  title: string;\n  position: { x: number; y: number; w: number; h: number };\n  config: WidgetConfig;\n  dataSource: DataSourceConfig;\n}\n\ntype WidgetType = \n  | 'metric-card'      // Single KPI with trend\n  | 'line-chart'       // Time series\n  | 'bar-chart'        // Categorical comparison\n  | 'pie-chart'        // Distribution\n  | 'table'            // Tabular data\n  | 'agent-list'       // Agent status list\n  | 'activity-feed'    // Recent events stream\n  | 'cost-breakdown'   // Cost visualization\n  | 'heatmap'          // Usage patterns\n  | 'gauge'            // Progress/capacity\n  | 'text'             // Markdown content\n  | 'iframe';          // External embeds\n```\n\n### Widget Type Specifications\n\n**Metric Cards:**\n- Single value display with optional sparkline\n- Trend indicator (up/down/neutral with percentage)\n- Threshold-based coloring (green/yellow/red)\n- Click-through to detailed view\n\n**Charts (Line, Bar, Pie):**\n- Built on Chart.js or Recharts\n- Configurable time ranges\n- Multiple series support\n- Legend positioning\n- Tooltip customization\n- Export as PNG/SVG\n\n**Tables:**\n- Sortable columns\n- Pagination\n- Column visibility toggles\n- Row click actions\n- Inline search/filter\n- CSV export\n\n**Agent Lists:**\n- Status indicators (active/idle/error/offline)\n- Quick actions (pause, configure, view logs)\n- Grouping by team/project/model\n- Search and filter\n\n**Activity Feeds:**\n- Real-time updates via WebSocket\n- Event type filtering\n- Expandable details\n- Jump to related entity\n\n### Widget Configuration Panel\n\n```typescript\ninterface WidgetConfigPanel {\n  // Common settings\n  title: string;\n  description?: string;\n  refreshInterval?: number;\n  \n  // Data source\n  dataSource: {\n    type: 'api' | 'query' | 'static';\n    endpoint?: string;\n    query?: string; // For custom queries\n    filters?: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e;\n    timeRange?: TimeRange;\n  };\n  \n  // Display settings (type-specific)\n  display: {\n    colorScheme?: string;\n    showLegend?: boolean;\n    showGrid?: boolean;\n    // ... type-specific options\n  };\n  \n  // Thresholds\n  thresholds?: {\n    warning?: number;\n    critical?: number;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Auto-Refresh Configuration\n\n```typescript\ninterface RefreshConfig {\n  globalInterval: number; // Dashboard-wide default\n  widgetOverrides: Map\u003cstring, number\u003e; // Per-widget overrides\n  pauseOnHidden: boolean; // Pause when tab not visible\n  pauseOnError: boolean; // Pause widget on consecutive errors\n  maxRetries: number; // Before pausing\n}\n```\n\n### Sharing and Access Control\n\n```typescript\ninterface DashboardSharing {\n  visibility: 'private' | 'team' | 'public';\n  teamId?: string; // Required for 'team' visibility\n  \n  // Granular permissions\n  viewers: string[]; // User IDs with read access\n  editors: string[]; // User IDs with edit access\n  \n  // Public options\n  publicSlug?: string; // URL-friendly identifier\n  requireAuth: boolean; // Require login even for public\n  embedEnabled: boolean;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-kue","title":"TASK: Risk Mitigations and Resilience","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead tracks the mitigation strategies for the 16+ risks identified in PLAN.md §26 (Risk Register). While many mitigations are implemented by specific feature beads, this bead ensures all risks have explicit mitigation coverage and testing.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\n### Why This Bead Exists\nRisk management requires visibility. Individual features implement mitigations, but without central tracking we can't verify:\n1. All risks have assigned mitigations\n2. Mitigations are actually tested\n3. Residual risk is acceptable\n\n### Risk Matrix\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Primary Mitigation Bead |\n|------|------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Agent runaway | Medium | High | flywheel_gateway-398 (Lifecycle) |\n| Account quota exhaustion | High | High | flywheel_gateway-41h (CAAM) |\n| File conflicts | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-5nm + flywheel_gateway-3b1 |\n| Context overflow | High | Medium | flywheel_gateway-ew1 (Auto-Healing) |\n| Work handoff failures | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-2pl (Handoff Protocol) |\n| Checkpoint storage explosion | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-36m (Delta Checkpoints) |\n| Network interruption | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-46c (WebSocket) |\n| Daemon failure | Low | High | flywheel_gateway-76h (Supervisor) |\n| Data loss | Low | Critical | flywheel_gateway-36m + flywheel_gateway-toe |\n| Security breach | Low | Critical | flywheel_gateway-bz1 (Security) |\n| Coordination visibility | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-c6q (Collab Graph) |\n| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-mag (Performance) |\n| Provider outage | Low | High | flywheel_gateway-41h (Multi-provider) |\n| Cost overruns | Medium | High | flywheel_gateway-rgx (Cost Analytics) |\n| Notification fatigue | Medium | Low | flywheel_gateway-59c (Notifications) |\n| Agent performance blind spots | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-6wp (Performance Analytics) |\n| Flywheel visibility gaps | Low | Medium | flywheel_gateway-66n (Velocity Dashboard) |\n\n## Risk Mitigation Details\n\n### 1.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-lil","title":"TASK: Parity Gate Tests","description":"## Background\n\nParity Gate Tests ensure that the Flywheel Gateway maintains consistency across all its interfaces and documentation. As the system grows with multiple access methods (REST API, WebSocket, CLI, AI-assisted), it becomes critical to verify that:\n\n1. Every command is accessible through all intended interfaces\n2. Documentation stays synchronized with implementation\n3. Schema definitions match actual behavior\n4. No commands are accidentally \"orphaned\" without proper bindings\n\n### The Parity Problem\n\nWithout automated verification, systems tend to drift:\n- New commands added without REST bindings\n- AI hints outdated or missing for commands\n- OpenAPI spec doesn't match actual endpoints\n- WebSocket events undocumented\n- Schema validation inconsistent\n\nParity Gate Tests run in CI to catch these

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-ls4","title":"FEAT: Shared Error Taxonomy + AI Hints","description":"## Background\n\nFlywheel Gateway requires a unified error handling system that serves three distinct audiences:\n1. **Human Developers** - Need clear, actionable error messages during development\n2. **AI Agents** - Need structured hints to understand what went wrong and how to recover\n3. **Client Applications** - Need consistent HTTP status codes and error formats for programmatic handling\n\nThe error taxonomy must be comprehensive enough to cover all failure modes across the gateway ecosystem while remaining extensible for future use cases.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why a Shared Error Package?\n- **Consistency**: All packages (gateway, drivers, SDK) use identical error codes\n- **Type Safety**: TypeScript discriminated unions ensure exhaustive error handling\n- **AI Integration**: Built-in hints help AI agents self-correct without human intervention\n- **Observability**: Structured errors enable better logging, metrics, and alerting\n\n### Error Code Design Philosophy\nError codes follow the pattern: `{DOMAIN}_{SPECIFIC_ERROR}`\n- Domain prefixes: `AGENT_`, `SPAWN_`, `DRIVER_`, `WS_`, `AUTH_`, `RATE_`, `SYSTEM_`\n- This enables filtering/routing by domain while maintaining specificity\n\n## Scope \u0026 Requirements\n\n### Core Error Codes to Define\n\n**Agent Lifecycle Errors:**\n- `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` - Agent ID does not exist or was garbage collected\n- `AGENT_ALREADY_EXISTS` - Attempt to spawn with duplicate ID\n- `AGENT_TERMINATED` - Operation on already-terminated agent\n- `AGENT_BUSY` - Agent currently processing, cannot accept new commands\n- `AGENT_TIMEOUT` - Agent did not respond within configured timeout\n\n**Spawn Errors:**\n- `SPAWN_FAILED` - Generic spawn failure (driver-specific details in metadata)\n- `SPAWN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` - User/workspace has reached agent spawn limit\n- `SPAWN_INVALID_CONFIG` - Invalid spawn configuration parameters\n- `SPAWN_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE` - Requested driver not available/healthy\n\n**Driver Errors:**\n- `DRIVER_NOT_FOUND` - Unknown driver type requested\n- `DRIVER_INIT_FAILED` - Driver failed to initialize\n- `DRIVER_COMMUNICATION_ERROR` - Lost connection to underlying agent process\n- `DRIVER_PROTOCOL_ERROR` - Unexpected message format from agent\n\n**WebSocket Errors:**\n- `WS_CONNECTION_FAILED` - Failed to establish WebSocket connection\n- `WS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` - Missing or invalid auth token\n- `WS_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED` - Not authorized for requested channel\n- `WS_CURSOR_EXPIRED` - Requested replay cursor no longer in ring buffer\n- `WS_RATE_LIMITED` - Too many messages/connections\n\n**Authentication/Authorization:**\n- `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` - Malformed or expired token\n- `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` - Token past expiration time\n- `AUTH_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE` - Token lacks required permissions\n- `AUTH_workspace_SUSPENDED` - workspace account suspended\n\n**Rate Limiting:**\n- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - Request rate limit exceeded\n- `RATE_CONCURRENT_LIMIT` - Too many concurrent operations\n\n**System Errors:**\n- `SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE` - Service temporarily unavailable\n- `SYSTEM_INTERNAL_ERROR` - Unexpected internal error\n- `SYSTEM_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` - Memory/CPU/disk limits reached\n\n### HTTP Status Mappings\n\n```typescript\nconst HTTP_STATUS_MAP: Record\u003cErrorCode, number\u003e = {\n  // 4xx Client Errors\n  AGENT_NOT_FOUND: 404,\n  AGENT_ALREADY_EXISTS: 409,\n  AGENT_TERMINATED: 410,  // Gone\n  AGENT_BUSY: 423,        // Locked\n  AGENT_TIMEOUT: 408,\n  \n  SPAWN_INVALID_CONFIG: 400,\n  SPAWN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED: 429,\n  SPAWN_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE: 503,\n  \n  DRIVER_NOT_FOUND: 400,\n  \n  WS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED: 401,\n  WS_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED: 403,\n  WS_CURSOR_EXPIRED: 410,\n  WS_RATE_LIMITED: 429,\n  \n  AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID: 401,\n  AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED: 401,\n  AUTH_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE: 403,\n  AUTH_workspace_SUSPENDED: 403,\n  \n  RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: 429,\n  RATE_CONCURRENT_LIMIT: 429,\n  \n  // 5xx Server Errors\n  SPAWN_FAILED: 500,\n  DRIVER_INIT_FAILED: 500,\n  DRIVER_COMMUNICATION_ERROR: 502,\n  DRIVER_PROTOCOL_ERROR: 502,\n  WS_CONNECTION_FAILED: 502,\n  SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE: 503,\n  SYSTEM_INTERNAL_ERROR: 500,\n  SYSTEM_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: 503,\n};\n```\n\n### AI-Friendly Error Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface GatewayError {\n  code: ErrorCode;\n  message: string;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-msz","title":"Conflict Detection and Alerts","description":"## Background\n\nConflict Detection and Alerts provides proactive identification of potential conflicts before they cause problems. While the File Reservation System prevents conflicts through coordination, this system detects conflicts that occur despite reservations or in uncoordinated scenarios.\n\nThree types of conflicts are detected:\n1. **Reservation Overlaps**: Two agents request conflicting file patterns\n2. **Git Conflicts**: Actual merge conflicts in version control\n3. **Resource Contention**: Competition for shared resources (APIs, databases)\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Conflict Types\n```typescript\ntype ConflictType = \n  | 'reservation_overlap'    // Pattern intersection\n  | 'git_merge_conflict'     // Actual file conflict\n  | 'git_potential_conflict' // Same file, different branches\n  | 'resource_contention'    // API rate limits, DB locks\n  | 'deadlock_detected';     // Circular wait condition\n\ninterface Conflict {\n  id: string;\n  type: ConflictType;\n  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical';\n  projectId: string;\n  involvedAgents: string[];\n  affectedResources: string[];  // Files, APIs, etc.\n  detectedAt: Date;\n  resolvedAt?: Date;\n  resolution?: ConflictResolution;\n  metadata: Record\u003cstring, any\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Detection Strategies\n\n#### 1. Reservation Overlap Detection\nReal-time detection when reservations are created:\n```typescript\nasync detectReservationOverlap(\n  newReservation: ReservationRequest\n): Promise\u003cOverlapConflict[]\u003e {\n  const activeReservations = await this.getActiveReservations(\n    newReservation.projectId\n  );\n  \n  return activeReservations\n    .filter(r =\u003e r.agentId !== newReservation.agentId)\n    .map(r =\u003e ({\n      existing: r,\n      overlap: this.computeOverlap(r.patterns, newReservation.patterns)\n    }))\n    .filter(r =\u003e r.overlap.length \u003e 0);\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Git Conflict Detection\nPeriodic and event-driven git status checking:\n```typescript\nasync detectGitConflicts(projectId: string): Promise\u003cGitConflict[]\u003e {\n  const conflicts: GitConflict[] = [];\n  \n  // Check for actual merge conflicts\n  const mergeStatus = await this.git.status();\n  if (mergeStatus.conflicted.length \u003e 0) {\n    conflicts.push({\n      type: 'git_merge_conflict',\n      files: mergeStatus.conflicted,\n      severity: 'critical'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  // Check for potential conflicts (same file modified on different branches)\n  const branches = await this.getActiveBranches(projectId);\n  for (const [b1, b2] of combinations(branches, 2)) {\n    const commonFiles = await this.findCommonModifiedFiles(b1, b2);\n    if (commonFiles.length \u003e 0) {\n      conflicts.push({\n        type: 'git_potential_conflict',\n        files: commonFiles,\n        branches: [b1, b2],\n        severity: 'warning'\n      });\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return conflicts;\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Resource Contention Detection\nMonitor shared resource access patterns:\n```typescript\ninterface ResourceAccess {\n  resourceId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  accessType: 'read' | 'write' | 'exclusive';\n  timestamp: Date;\n}\n\nasync detectResourceContention(\n  projectId: string,\n  windowMs: number = 5000\n): Promise\u003cContentionConflict[]\u003e {\n  const recentAccesses = await this.getRecentAccesses(projectId, windowMs);\n  \n  // Group by resource\n  const byResource = groupBy(recentAccesses, 'resourceId');\n  \n  return Object.entries(byResource)\n    .filter(([_, accesses]) =\u003e this.hasContention(accesses))\n    .map(([resourceId, accesses]) =\u003e ({\n      type: 'resource_contention',\n      resourceId,\n      involvedAgents: unique(accesses.map(a =\u003e a.agentId)),\n      severity: 'warning'\n    }));\n}\n```\n\n### Alert System\n\n#### Alert Configuration\n```typescript\ninterface AlertConfig {\n  channels: AlertChannel[];  // websocket, email, slack, webhook\n  thresholds: {\n    [K in ConflictType]: {\n      minSeverity: Severity;\n      cooldownMs: number;    // Prevent alert spam\n    };\n  };\n  escalation: {\n    afterMs: number;\n    escalateTo: AlertChannel[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n#### WebSocket Events\n```typescript\n// Emitted events\n'conflict.detected'     // New conflict found\n'conflict.updated'      // Conflict status changed\n'conflict.resolved'     // Conflict resolved\n'conflict.escalated'    // Conflict escalated\n\n// Event payload\ninterface ConflictEvent {\n  eventType: string;\n  conflict: Conflict;\n  timestamp: Date;\n  recommendedActions: Action[];\n}\n```\n\n### Recommended Actions\nSystem suggests resolutions based on conflict type:\n```typescript\nfunction getRecommendedActions(conflict: Conflict): Action[] {\n  switch (conflict.type) {\n    case 'reservation_overlap':\n      return [\n        { action: 'wait', description: 'Wait for existing reservation to expire' },\n        { action: 'negotiate', description: 'Request partial pattern release' },\n        { action: 'force', description: 'Override (requires admin)' }\n      ];\n    \n    case 'git_merge_conflict':\n      return [\n        { action: 'manual_resolve', description: 'Human intervention required' },\n        { action: 'abort_merge', description: 'Abort and retry later' },\n        { action: 'accept_ours', description: 'Keep current branch changes' },\n        { action: 'accept_theirs', description: 'Accept incoming changes' }\n      ];\n    \n    case 'resource_contention':\n      return [\n        { action: 'queue', description: 'Queue request for later' },\n        { action: 'retry_backoff', description: 'Retry with exponential backoff' },\n        { action: 'alternative', description: 'Use alternative resource' }\n      ];\n    \n    default:\n      return [{ action: 'investigate', description: 'Manual investigation needed' }];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/conflict.service.ts` | Core conflict detection |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/conflict.types.ts`

Unlike the SDK driver which embeds agent logic directly, the ACP driver treats agents as separate processes that communicate via a standardized protocol.\n\nThis separation provides several critical benefits:\n- Language independence: agents can be written in Python, Rust, Go, etc.\n- Process isolation: agent crashes don't affect the gateway\n- Scalability: agents can run on different machines\n- Development flexibility: agents can be developed and tested independently\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Protocol Design\n- **Transport**: Bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket or stdio\n- **Message Types**: Request, Response, Notification\n- **Serialization**: JSON with optional MessagePack for performance\n- **Framing**: Length-prefixed messages for stdio, native WebSocket frames\n\n### Core Methods\n```typescript\n// Gateway -\u003e Agent\nagent.initialize(config: AgentConfig): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\nagent.executeTask(task: Task): Promise\u003cTaskResult\u003e\nagent.handleMessage(message: AgentMessage): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\nagent.shutdown(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e\n\n// Agent -\u003e Gateway (notifications)\ngateway.taskProgress(taskId: string, progress: Progress): void\ngateway.requestTool(toolName: string, params: any): Promise\u003cany\u003e\ngateway.logEvent(event: LogEvent): void\n```\n\n### Connection Lifecycle\n1. Gateway spawns agent process or accepts incoming connection\n2. Handshake with capability negotiation\n3. Agent registers available tools and capabilities\n4. Gateway sends tasks, agent responds\n5. Graceful shutdown with pending task completion\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### AgentDriver Interface Compliance\nThe ACP driver MUST implement the same `AgentDriver` interface as the SDK driver:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  capabilities: DriverCapabilities;\n  \n  connect(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  disconnect(): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  isConnected(): boolean;\n  \n  executeTask(task: Task): Promise\u003cTaskResult\u003e;\n  cancelTask(taskId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  on(event: DriverEvent, handler: EventHandler): void;\n  off(event: DriverEvent, handler: EventHandler): void;\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling Strategy\n- Connection errors: exponential backoff with jitter (100ms to 30s)\n- Task timeout: configurable per-task with default 5 minutes\n- Protocol errors: log, notify, attempt recovery\n- Process crashes: detect via exit codes, restart with backoff\n\n### Connection Management\n- Connection pool for multiple agent instances\n- Health checks via ping/pong every 30 seconds\n- Automatic reconnection on disconnect\n- Graceful drain on shutdown\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/index.ts` | Public exports |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/acp-driver.ts` | Main driver implementation |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/protocol.ts` | JSON-RPC message types and serialization |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/connection.ts` | WebSocket/stdio connection handling |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/pool.ts` | Connection pool management |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/errors.ts` | ACP-specific error classes |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/__tests__/` | Unit and integration tests |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Implements AgentDriver interface identically to SDK driver\n- [ ] Supports both WebSocket and stdio transports\n- [ ] JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant message handling\n- [ ] Connection pool with configurable size (default: 5)\n- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff\n- [ ] Health check mechanism with configurable interval\n- [ ] Graceful shutdown drains pending tasks\n- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with typed errors\n- [ ] \u003e90% test coverage for protocol handling\n- [ ] Integration test with mock agent process\n- [ ] Performance: \u003c10ms overhead per message\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md Section 5: Agent Driver Architecture\n- PLAN.md Section 6: Protocol Specifications\n- JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification: https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `ws` - WebSocket client/server\n- `uuid` - Request ID generation\n- Shared types from `@flywheel/types`\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Validate all incoming JSON-RPC messages\n- Limit message size (default: 10MB)\n- Rate limit requests per connection\n- Authentication via shared secret in handshake\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] ACP JSON-RPC request/response parsing validates schema and handles out-of-order responses\n- [ ] Event stream parsing handles tool_call/tool_result/text_delta and preserves ordering\n- [ ] Reconnect/resume logic handles transient disconnects without duplicating events\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Use a stub ACP agent to run a short session and verify output streaming + interrupts\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Protocol errors/timeouts map to driver error codes and do not crash the gateway\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-p0l","title":"FEAT: SLB Safety Guardrails","description":"## Overview\n\nConfigurable safety limits and approval workflows for the Session Lock Broker (SLB). Safety Guardrails provide multi-layered protection against runaway agents, resource abuse, and potentially dangerous operations through declarative rules, rate limiting, and human-in-the-loop approval workflows.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nAutonomous agents operating with tool access pose inherent risks:\n\n- **Runaway Agents**: An agent stuck in a loop can consume unlimited resources or make endless API calls\n- **Resource Abuse**: Without limits, agents can exhaust disk space, network bandwidth, or compute time\n- **Dangerous Operations**: Some operations (forced pushes, recursive deletion, production deployments) require human oversight\n- **Cost Overruns**: LLM token usage and external API calls can generate unexpected expenses\n- **Data Exfiltration**: Agents with network access could potentially leak sensitive information\n\nSafety Guardrails transform these risks into manageable, auditable controls with clear escalation paths.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Safety Categories\n\n| Category | Scope | Examples |\n|----------|-------|----------|\n| `filesystem` | File and directory operations | Path restrictions, write limits, deletion controls |\n| `git` | Version control operations | Branch protections, forced push blocking, commit limits |\n| `network` | External communication | URL allowlists, request rate limits, data transfer caps |\n| `execution` | Command and script execution | Command blocking, timeout enforcement, process limits |\n| `resources` | System resource usage | Memory caps, CPU limits, disk quotas |\n| `content` | Generated content validation | PII detection, secret scanning, policy compliance |\n\n### Path Allowlists and Denylists\n\n```typescript\ninterface PathRule {\n  pattern: string;      // Glob pattern (e.g., '/workspace/**', '!**/node_modules/**')\n  action: 'allow' | 'deny';\n  operations: ('read' | 'write' | 'delete' | 'execute')[];\n  reason?: string;      // Displayed to agent when blocked\n}\n\n// Evaluation order: deny rules checked first, then allow rules\n// Default: deny if no matching allow rule\n```\n\n### Command Blocking Rules\n\n```typescript\ninterface CommandRule {\n  pattern: string;           // Regex pattern for command matching\n  severity: 'block' | 'warn' | 'approve';\n  category: SafetyCategory;\n  reason: string;\n  alternatives?: string[];   // Suggested safer alternatives\n}\n\n// Example rules:\n// - block: recursive forced deletion from root\n// - approve: forced git push (requires approval)\n// - warn: piping curl output to shell\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\n```typescript\ninterface RateLimitConfig {\n  scope: 'agent' | 'workspace' | 'session';\n  limits: {\n    tokensPerMinute: number;\n    requestsPerMinute: number;\n    fileWritesPerMinute: number;\n    networkRequestsPerMinute: number;\n    commandsPerMinute: number;\n  };\n  burstAllowance: number;    // Percentage above limit for short bursts\n  cooldownSeconds: number;   // Wait time after limit exceeded\n}\n```\n\n### Approval Queue\n\n```typescript\ninterface ApprovalRequest {\n  id: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  sessionId: string;\n  operation: {\n    type: SafetyCategory;\n    command?: string;\n    path?: string;\n    description: string;\n  };\n  rule: SafetyRule;          // Rule that triggered approval\n  context: {\n    recentActions: Action[]; // Last 10 agent actions for context\n    taskDescription?: string;\n  };\n  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied' | 'expired';\n  requestedAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;           // Auto-deny after timeout\n  decidedBy?: string;        // User who approved/denied\n  decidedAt?: Date;\n  decisionReason?: string;\n}\n```\n\n### Cost Limits and Budget Enforcement\n\n```typescript\ninterface BudgetConfig {\n  scope: 'agent' | 'workspace' | 'session';\n  limits: {\n    totalTokens: number;\n    totalDollars: number;\n    perRequestDollars: number;\n  };\n  alertThresholds: number[]; // e.g., [0.5, 0.8, 0.95] for 50%, 80%, 95%\n  action: 'warn' | 'pause' | 'terminate';\n}\n```\n\n## Key Interfaces\n\n```typescript\ninterface SafetyConfig {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  name: string;\n  description?: string;\n  enabled: boolean;\n  categories: {\n    [K in SafetyCategory]: {\n      enabled: boolean;\n      rules: SafetyRule[];\n    };\n  };\n  rateLimits: RateLimitConfig;\n  budget: BudgetConfig;\n  approvalWorkflow: {\n    enabled: boolean;\n    approvers: string[];      // User IDs who can approve\n    timeoutMinutes: number;\n    defaultAction: 'deny' | 'allow';\n  };\n}\n\ninterface SafetyRule {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  category: SafetyCategory;\n  condition: RuleCondition;   // Pattern matching logic\n  action: 'allow' | 'deny' | 'warn' | 'approve';\n  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';\n  message: string;            // Shown to agent/user\n  enabled: boolean;\n}\n\ninterface SafetyViolation {\n  id:

'blocked' | 'warned' | 'pending_approval';\n  context: {\n    taskDescription?: string;\n    recentHistory: string[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n| Component | Path

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-p8j","title":"FEAT: Beads/BV Integration","description":"## Background\n\nThe Beads Viewer (BV) is the central intelligence layer of the Flywheel ecosystem, managing the dependency graph of all work items (beads). This integration enables Flywheel Gateway to leverage BV's graph-aware capabilities for intelligent work prioritization and bottleneck detection.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nCurrent task management systems treat work items as independent entities, leading to:\n- Developers picking up blocked work they cannot complete\n- Critical path items languishing while non-blocking work proceeds\n- No visibility into which completions would unblock the most downstream work\n- Manual effort to determine work dependencies\n\nBV solves this by maintaining a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of beads and their dependencies, enabling queries like \"what can I work on right now?\" and \"what's blocking the most work?\"\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Client Architecture\n- Use flywheel-clients package pattern for consistency\n- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Cache dependency graph locally with invalidation strategy\n- Support both REST and potential WebSocket for real-time updates\n\n### API Design\n```typescript\ninterface BVClient {\n  // CRUD Operations\n  createBead(bead: BeadCreate): Promise\u003cBead\u003e;\n  getBead(id: string): Promise\u003cBead\u003e;\n  updateBead(id: string, updates: BeadUpdate): Promise\u003cBead\u003e;\n  deleteBead(id: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  // Triage Operations\n  getReadyBeads(filters?: TriageFilters): Promise\u003cBead[]\u003e;\n  getBlockedBeads(filters?: TriageFilters): Promise\u003cBlockedBead[]\u003e;\n  triageWork(context: TriageContext): Promise\u003cPrioritizedWork\u003e;\n  \n  // Insights\n  getBottlenecks(limit?: number): Promise\u003cBottleneck[]\u003e;\n  getKeystones(limit?: number): Promise\u003cKeystone[]\u003e;\n  getDependencyGraph(rootId?: string): Promise\u003cDependencyGraph\u003e;\n  \n  // Dependency Management\n  addDependency(beadId: string, dependsOn: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  removeDependency(beadId: string, dependsOn: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  getBlockers(beadId: string): Promise\u003cBead[]\u003e;\n  getDependents(beadId: string): Promise\u003cBead[]\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n### Galaxy View (Dependency Visualization)\nThe Galaxy View renders the dependency graph as an interactive visualization:\n- Nodes represent beads, sized by downstream impact\n- Edges show dependency relationships\n- Color coding: ready (green), blocked (red), in-progress (yellow)\n- Zoom/pan for large graphs\n- Click to drill into bead details\n- Filter by project, tag, assignee\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- Triage queries must return in \u003c100ms for responsive UI\n- Graph rendering must handle 1000+ nodes smoothly\n- Use WebGL (via @xyflow/react (ReactFlow) or similar) for large graphs\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **BV Client Implementation**\n   - [ ] BVClient class with full TypeScript typing\n   - [ ] All CRUD operations functional\n   - [ ] Error handling with typed exceptions\n   - [ ] Request/response logging for debugging\n   - [ ] Unit tests with \u003e80% coverage\n\n2. **Triage API Integration**\n   - [ ] getReadyBeads returns beads with no unresolved blockers\n   - [ ] getBlockedBeads includes blocker information\n   - [ ] triageWork returns prioritized list considering:\n     - User skills/preferences\n     - Bead priority\n     - Downstream impact (keystone score)\n     - Time estimates\n\n3. **Insights API Integration**\n   - [ ] Bottleneck detection working (beads blocking most downstream work)\n   - [ ] Keystone identification (highest-impact completions)\n   - [ ] Metrics include: blocked count, estimated unblock value\n\n4. **Dependency Management**\n   - [ ] Add/remove dependencies with cycle detection\n   - [ ] Bulk dependency operations\n   - [ ] Dependency validation (no self-references, no cycles)\n\n5. **Galaxy View Component**\n   - [ ] Interactive graph rendering\n   - [ ] Node click shows bead details sidebar\n   - [ ] Filter controls (status, project, assignee)\n   - [ ] Legend explaining visual encoding\n   - [ ] Export graph as image/SVG\n   - [ ] Responsive design for different screen sizes\n\n6. **Integration Tests**\n   - [ ] End-to-end flow: create bead -\u003e add dependency -\u003e triage -\u003e complete\n   - [ ] Graph updates reflect in Galaxy View within 2 seconds\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Client Package\n- `packages/flywheel-clients/src/bv/index.ts` -

This bead implements comprehensive cost analytics that provide real-time visibility into AI usage, predictive forecasting to prevent budget overruns, and AI-powered optimization recommendations to reduce costs while maintaining quality.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nCost management for AI agents is uniquely challenging because:\n- **Variable Rates**: Different models have vastly different costs (GPT-4 vs Claude Haiku)\n- **Usage Patterns**: Costs vary by time of day, task type, and agent behavior\n- **Hidden Costs**: Retries, context overflow, and inefficient prompts inflate costs\n- **Rapid Growth**: Agent fleets can scale quickly, multiplying costs\n\nThe solution must provide:\n- Granular cost attribution to understand where resources goes\n- Proactive alerts before budgets are exhausted\n- Actionable recommendations with quantified savings\n- Historical analysis to identify cost trends and anomalies\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Cost Tracking Architecture\n\n**Cost Attribution Dimensions:**\n```typescript\ninterface CostRecord {\n  timestamp: Date;\n  organization_id: string;\n  project_id: string;\n  agent_id: string;\n  task_id: string;\n  model: string;\n  provider: 'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'google' | 'local';\n  \n  // Token breakdown\n  prompt_tokens: number;\n  completion_tokens: number;\n  cached_tokens: number;\n  \n  // Cost calculation\n  prompt_cost_units: number;\n  completion_cost_units: number;\n  total_cost_units: number;\n  \n  // Context\n  task_type: string;\n  complexity_tier: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';\n  success: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n**Real-time Cost Aggregation:**\n- Per-minute cost accumulation for real-time dashboards\n- Hourly rollups for trend analysis\n- Daily aggregates for reporting\n- Monthly summaries for reporting\n\n**Cost by Model:**\n```typescript\ninterface ModelCostBreakdown {\n  model: string;\n  total_cost_units: number;\n  percentage_of_total: number;\n  request_count: number;\n  avg_cost_per_request: number;\n  total_tokens: number;\n  cost_per_1k_tokens: number;\n  trend: CostTrend;\n}\n```\n\n**Cost by Agent:**\n- Individual agent cost tracking\n- Agent cost ranking (top spenders)\n- Cost per successful task by agent\n- Agent efficiency comparison\n\n**Cost by Task Type:**\n- Task classification for cost attribution\n- Cost benchmarks by task type\n- Anomaly detection for expensive tasks\n- Task type optimization opportunities\n\n### Budget Status Visualization\n\n**Budget Configuration:**\n```typescript\ninterface Budget {\n  id: string;\n  organization_id: string;\n  period: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';\n  amount_units: number;\n  alert_thresholds: number[]; // e.g., [50, 75, 90, 100]\n  action_on_exceed: 'alert' | 'throttle' | 'block';\n  rollover: boolean;\n  effective_date: Date;\n}\n```\n\n**Visual Progress Indicators:**\n- Circular progress gauge (0-100%)\n- Color coding: green (\u003c50%), yellow (50-80%), orange (80-95%), red (\u003e95%)\n- Burn rate indicator (current vs expected)\n- Days remaining at current rate\n- Comparison to previous period\n\n**Budget Alerts:**\n- Threshold-based notifications\n- Predictive alerts (\"Will exceed budget in 3 days\")\n- Spike detection (\"Cost increased 300% in last hour\")\n- Recovery notification when usage normalizes\n\n### 30-Day Cost Forecasting\n\n**Forecasting Model:**\n```typescript\ninterface CostForecast {\n  forecast_date: Date;\n  horizon_days: 30;\n  daily_forecasts: DailyForecast[];\n  total_forecast_units: number;\n  confidence_interval_95: {\n    lower: number;\n    upper: number;\n  };\n  methodology: 'arima' | 'prophet' | 'linear' | 'ensemble';\n  accuracy_metrics: {\n    mape: number; // Mean Absolute Percentage Error\n    rmse: number; // Root Mean Square Error\n  };\n}\n\ninterface DailyForecast {\n  date: Date;\n  predicted_cost_units: number;\n  lower_bound_units: number;\n  upper_bound_units: number;\n  confidence: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Forecasting Methodology:**\n1. **Historical Analysis**: Use 90 days of historical data\n2. **Seasonality Detection**: Weekly and monthly patterns\n3. **Trend Extraction**: Linear and exponential trends\n4. **Anomaly Handling**: Exclude outliers from training\n5. **Ensemble Approach**: Combine multiple models for robustness\n\n**Confidence Intervals:**\n- 95% confidence intervals for each day\n- Widening intervals for further predictions\n- Scenario modeling (optimistic, expected, pessimistic)\n- Sensitivity analysis for key drivers\n\n### AI-Powered Optimization Recommendations\n\n**Recommendation Categories:**\n\n1. **Model Optimization:**\n```typescript\n{\n  category: 'model_optimization',\n  title: 'Switch documentation tasks to Claude Haiku',\n  description: 'Analysis shows 847 documentation tasks last month used Claude Sonnet.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-toe","title":"Git Coordination Service","description":"## Overview\n\nThe Git Coordination Service provides centralized management of git operations across multiple agents working in the same repository. This is critical for Phase 3 Flywheel Integration where multiple AI agents may be simultaneously modifying code.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nWhen multiple agents operate on a shared codebase, git coordination becomes essential to prevent:\n- Merge conflicts from overlapping changes\n- Lost work from force pushes\n- Branch naming collisions\n- Inconsistent repository state\n\nThe Git Coordination Service acts as a single source of truth for branch assignments and provides predictive conflict detection before agents begin work.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **Branch Assignment Manager**\n   - Maintains registry of agent-to-branch mappings\n   - Enforces exclusive branch ownership\n   - Supports branch reservation with TTL\n   - Handles branch release on agent completion/timeout\n\n2. **Conflict Prediction Engine**\n   - Analyzes pending changes across all active branches\n   - Detects overlapping file modifications before they occur\n   - Uses git diff-tree for file-level conflict detection\n   - Provides semantic conflict hints (same function modified)\n\n3. **Sync Operations Manager**\n   - Coordinates pull operations with conflict checking\n   - Manages commit sequencing for dependent changes\n   - Handles push operations with retry logic\n   - Supports atomic multi-branch operations\n\n4. **Merge Base Analyzer**\n   - Tracks merge base for all active branches\n   - Calculates branch divergence metrics\n   - Recommends rebase timing\n   - Detects stale branches requiring attention\n\n### Frontend Components\n\n1. **BranchVisualization.tsx**\n   - D3.js-based git graph rendering\n   - Real-time branch status updates via WebSocket\n   - Interactive branch selection and comparison\n   - Commit history timeline\n\n2. **ConflictPredictor.tsx**\n   - Visual file overlap detection\n   - Agent workspace comparison\n   - Suggested resolution strategies\n\n3. **SyncStatusPanel.tsx**\n   - Per-agent sync status indicators\n   - Push/pull operation progress\n   - Error state visualization\n\n## API Design\n\n```typescript\ninterface GitCoordinationService {\n  // Branch Management\n  assignBranch(agentId: string, branchName: string): Promise\u003cBranchAssignment\u003e;\n  releaseBranch(agentId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  getBranchAssignments(): Promise\u003cBranchAssignment[]\u003e;\n  \n  // Conflict Prediction\n  predictConflicts(branchA: string, branchB: string): Promise\u003cConflictPrediction\u003e;\n  getOverlappingFiles(branches: string[]): Promise\u003cFileOverlapReport\u003e;\n  \n  // Sync Operations\n  syncBranch(agentId: string, operation: SyncOperation): Promise\u003cSyncResult\u003e;\n  getMergeBase(branch: string, target: string): Promise\u003cMergeBaseInfo\u003e;\n  \n  // Visualization Data\n  getGitGraph(options: GraphOptions): Promise\u003cGitGraphData\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface BranchAssignment {\n  agentId: string;\n  branchName: string;\n  assignedAt: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  status: 'active' | 'stale' | 'merged';\n}\n\ninterface ConflictPrediction {\n  hasConflicts: boolean;\n  conflictingFiles: string[];\n  severity: 'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';\n  recommendation: string;\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/git.service.ts` -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","title":"FEAT: Basic REST API (Spawn, Terminate, List, Send)","description":"## Background\n\nThe REST API is the primary interface for clients to interact with the Flywheel Gateway. It exposes agent lifecycle operations (spawn, terminate, list) and communication endpoints (send messages, get output).\n\nThe API design follows REST conventions while accommodating the unique needs of agent orchestration - long-running operations, streaming responses, and event-driven state changes.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why Hono?\n- **Performance**: Built on Web Standards (Request/Response), extremely fast\n- **TypeScript First**: Excellent type inference and validation\n- **Middleware Ecosystem**: Easy to compose with auth, logging, validation\n- **Edge Ready**: Works in Node, Deno, Bun, and edge runtimes\n- **Small Footprint**: Minimal dependencies, fast cold starts\n\n### Command Registry Pattern\nRoutes are generated from a declarative command registry:\n- Single source of truth for all commands\n- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation\n- Consistent validation and error handling\n- Easy to extend with new commands\n\n### Correlation IDs\nEvery request gets a correlation ID that flows through:\n- API logs\n- Agent driver calls\n- WebSocket messages\n- Error responses\n\nThis enables end-to-end request tracing.\n\n## Scope \u0026 Requirements\n\n###

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-w55","title":"FEAT: SDK Agent Driver Implementation","description":"## Background\n\nThe SDK Agent Driver is the primary mechanism for spawning and managing Claude Code agents within the Flywheel Gateway. It wraps the official `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` package, providing a consistent interface that can be extended with alternative drivers (Docker, remote, mock) in the future.\n\nThis driver is the heart of agent lifecycle management - it must handle the full spectrum of agent states, gracefully manage failures, and provide clean abstractions for the gateway layer above.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why an AgentDriver Interface?\n- **Pluggability**: Different environments need different agent backends (local SDK, Docker containers, remote clusters)\n- **Testability**: Mock drivers enable gateway testing without spawning real agents\n- **Future-Proofing**: New agent types (Claude 4, custom models) plug in via new drivers\n\n### State Machine Design\nAgents have complex lifecycles. A formal state machine prevents invalid transitions and makes behavior predictable:\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n                    │                                         │\n                    ▼                                         │\n┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌───────────┐  │\n│ pending │───▶│ spawning │───▶│  ready  │◀──▶│ executing │──┤\n└─────────┘    └──────────┘    └─────────┘    └───────────┘  │\n                    │               │              │          │\n                    │               │              │          │\n                    ▼               ▼              ▼          │\n               ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐   │\n               │              terminated                  │◀──┘\n               └─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nValid transitions:\n- `pending → spawning`: Driver begins spawn process\n- `spawning → ready`: Agent process started, SDK connected\n- `spawning → terminated`: Spawn failed\n- `ready → executing`: Command sent to agent\n- `executing → ready`: Command completed\n- `executing → paused`: Interrupt received (SIGTSTP equivalent)\n- `paused → executing`: Resume command sent\n- `* → terminated`: Terminate called or fatal error\n\n### PTY Integration\nAgents need terminal I/O for:\n- Interactive tool use (editors, REPLs)\n- Proper signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)\n- Terminal resize events\n- Raw mode for special characters\n\n## Scope \u0026 Requirements\n\n### AgentDriver Interface\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  readonly driverId: string;\n  readonly driverType: 'sdk' | 'docker' | 'remote' | 'mock';\n  \n  // Lifecycle\n  spawn(config: SpawnConfig): Promise\u003cAgentHandle\u003e;\n  terminate(agentId: string, options?: TerminateOptions): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  // Communication\n  send(agentId: string, message: AgentMessage): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  interrupt(agentId: string, signal?: InterruptSignal): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  // State\n  getState(agentId: string): AgentState;\n  getOutput(agentId: string, cursor?: string): AsyncIterable\u003cOutputChunk\u003e;\n  \n  // Events\n  on(event: DriverEvent, handler: DriverEventHandler): void;\n  off(event: DriverEvent, handler: DriverEventHandler): void;\n}\n\ninterface SpawnConfig {\n  agentId: string;\n  workingDirectory: string;\n  environment?: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e;\n  pty?: PtyConfig;\n  timeout?: number;\n  maxTokens?: number;\n  systemPrompt?: string;\n  tools?: ToolDefinition[];\n  mcpServers?: McpServerConfig[];\n}\n\ninterface AgentHandle {\n  agentId: string;\n  state: AgentState;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  pid?: number;\n  ptyFd?: number;\n}\n\ninterface TerminateOptions {\n  graceful?: boolean;      // Try SIGTERM before SIGKILL\n  timeoutMs?: number;      // Max time to wait for graceful shutdown\n  preserveOutput?: boolean; // Keep output in buffer after termination\n}\n\ntype InterruptSignal = 'SIGINT' | 'SIGTSTP' | 'SIGCONT' | 'SIGHUP';\n```\n\n### SDK Driver Specifics\n\nThe SDK driver wraps `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`:\n\n```typescript\nclass SdkAgentDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly driverId = 'sdk-primary';\n  readonly driverType = 'sdk';\n  \n  private agents: Map\u003cstring, SdkAgentContext\u003e;\n  private eventEmitter: EventEmitter;\n  \n  constructor(private config: SdkDriverConfig) {}\n  \n  async spawn(config: SpawnConfig): Promise\u003cAgentHandle\u003e {\n    // 1.

Skip this if you're already familiar with the Agent Flywheel ecosystem.\n\n### The Problem: AI Agents Working in Isolation\n\nThe AI coding agent revolution is here. Tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codex can write code, run tests, and even debug complex issues. But there's a fundamental problem:\n\n**AI agents work in isolation.**\n\nWhen you run Claude Code on a project, it operates alone. It doesn't know:\n- What other agents are working on the same codebase\n- What decisions were made in previous sessions\n- Which files another agent is currently editing\n- What patterns have worked (or failed) in similar past tasks\n- Whether the code it's about to write will conflict with parallel work\n\nThis isolation creates waste:\n- **Duplicate work** — Two agents solve the same problem differently\n- **Merge conflicts** — Agents edit the same files simultaneously\n- **Lost knowledge** — Insights from one session don't carry to the next\n- **No coordination** — Agents can't delegate, escalate, or collaborate\n- **Human bottleneck** — You become the message-passing middleware between agents\n\n### The Vision: The Agent Flywheel\n\nThe **Agent Flywheel** is a self-improving development cycle where AI coding agents work in parallel, coordinate via messaging, and compound their learnings over time.\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n                    │         THE AGENT FLYWHEEL              │\n                    │      (Self-Reinforcing Cycle)           │\n                    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n                              ┌──────────┐\n                              │   PLAN   │\n                              │   (BV)   │\n                              └────┬─────┘\n                                   │\n            What work is ready?    │    Graph analysis reveals\n            What's blocked?        │    optimal task ordering\n            What's the critical    │\n            path?                  ▼\n                              ┌──────────┐\n         ┌────────────────────│COORDINATE│────────────────────┐\n         │                    │(Ag Mail) │                    │\n         │                    └────┬─────┘                    │\n         │                         │                          │\n         │  Agents claim work,     │   Reserve files,         │\n         │  message each other,    │   resolve conflicts,     │\n         │  share discoveries      │   handoff context        │\n         │                         ▼                          │\n         │                    ┌──────────┐                    │\n         │                    │ EXECUTE  │                    │\n         │                    │(Gateway) │                    │\n         │                    └────┬─────┘                    │\n         │                         │                          │\n         │  Spawn agents,          │   SDK-first execution,   │\n         │  stream output,         │   real-time monitoring,  │\n         │  manage lifecycle       │   checkpoints            │\n         │                         ▼                          │\n         │                    ┌──────────┐                    │\n         │                    │   SCAN   │                    │\n         │                    │  (UBS)   │                    │\n         │                    └────┬─────┘                    │\n         │                         │                          │\n         │  Quality gates,         │   Catch issues before    │\n         │  security checks,       │   they compound          │\n         │  anti-pattern detection │                          │\n         │                         ▼                          │\n         │                    ┌──────────┐                    │\n         └───────────────────▶│ REMEMBER │◀───────────────────┘\n                              │(CASS+CM) │\n                              └────┬─────┘\n                                   │\n            Index sessions,        │    Extract rules,\n            semantic search,       │    build playbooks,\n            find prior solutions   │    improve prompts\n                                   │\n                                   ▼\n                           ┌───────────────┐\n                           │ NEXT CYCLE    │\n                           │ IS BETTER     │\n                           └───────────────┘\n\n    Each revolution of the flywheel:\n    • Agents have more context (from CASS/CM)\n    • Work is better prioritized (from BV)\n    • Conflicts are prevented (from Agent Mail)\n    • Quality is maintained (from UBS)\n    • Execution is faster (from Gateway optimizations)\n```\n\nThe flywheel is **self-reinforcing**: each cycle generates knowledge that makes the next cycle faster and higher quality. Over time, the agents become more effective because they're building on accumulated intelligence rather than starting fresh each time.\n\n### The Flywheel Tools\n\nThe Agent Flywheel is implemented through interconnected tools organized into core orchestration components and developer utilities. Understanding each tool is essential to understanding this plan.\n\n#### 1. Flywheel Gateway (This Project)\n\n**What it is:** The orchestration backbone—a web platform that spawns, monitors, and coordinates AI coding agents.\n\n**Key responsibilities:**\n- Spawn agents via multiple backends (SDK, ACP protocol, Tmux terminals)\n- Stream agent output in real-time via WebSocket\n- Manage agent lifecycle (pause, resume, checkpoint, terminate)\n- Provide unified REST API for all flywheel tools\n- Host the web UI for human visibility and control\n- Manage BYOA accounts and rotate API keys when used (BYOK)\n- Build \"context packs\" that give agents situational awareness\n\n**Why it matters:** Without Gateway, agents are invisible black boxes. With Gateway, you have a command center showing what every agent is doing, with the ability to intervene when needed.\n\n#### 2. Agent Mail\n\n**What it is:** A messaging and coordination system for AI agents, implemented as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.\n\n**Key responsibilities:**\n- **Messaging:** Agents send messages to each other (project updates, questions, handoffs)\n- **File Reservations:** Advisory locks that prevent edit conflicts (\"I'm working on auth.ts\")\n- **Thread Management:** Conversations are threaded for context preservation\n- **Project Identity:** Agents register under projects (working directory as identity)\n- **Contact Policies:** Control which agents can message which others\n\n**Key concepts:**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     AGENT MAIL ARCHITECTURE                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  PROJECT: /data/projects/my-app                                 │\n│  ├── Agent: GreenCastle (claude-code, opus-4.5)                │\n│  │   ├── Inbox: 3 unread messages                              │\n│  │   ├── Reservations: src/api/*.ts (exclusive, 2hr TTL)       │\n│  │   └── Status: Working on API refactor                       │\n│  │                                                              │\n│  ├── Agent: BlueLake (codex-cli, gpt-5)                        │\n│  │   ├── Inbox: 1 unread message                               │\n│  │   ├── Reservations: tests/*.test.ts (exclusive, 1hr TTL)    │\n│  │   └── Status: Writing test coverage                         │\n│  │                                                              │\n│  └── Agent: RedStone (claude-code, sonnet-4)                   │\n│      ├── Inbox: 0 unread messages                              │\n│      ├── Reservations: none                                     │\n│      └── Status: Idle, awaiting work                           │\n│                                                                 │\n│  THREADS:                                                       │\n│  ├── TKT-123: \"API Authentication Refactor\"                    │\n│  │   └── 12 messages, 3 participants                           │\n│  └── TKT-124: \"Fix login redirect bug\"                         │\n│      └── 5 messages, 2 participants                            │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without Agent Mail, agents step on each other's toes. With Agent Mail, they coordinate like a team—claiming work, signaling progress, and handing off context cleanly.\n\n#### 3. bd (Beads)\n\n**What it is:** An issue/task tracking system designed for AI-agent workflows. Think \"GitHub Issues but optimized for agents.\"\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Bead:** A unit of work (bug, feature, task, chore)\n- **Dependencies:** Beads can depend on other beads (forms a DAG)\n- **Status:** draft → ready → in_progress → review → done\n- **Metadata:** Priority, assignee (can be agent name), labels, time estimates\n\n**Why \"beads\"?** The metaphor is a string of beads—work items threaded together by dependencies, forming a necklace of progress.\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      BEADS DEPENDENCY GRAPH                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│    ┌─────────┐                                                  │\n│    │ BEADS-1 │ \"Set up database schema\"                        │\n│    │  DONE   │                                                  │\n│    └────┬────┘                                                  │\n│         │                                                       │\n│    ┌────┴────┐                                                  │\n│    ▼         ▼                                                  │\n│ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐                                        │\n│ │ BEADS-2 │ │ BEADS-3 │                                        │\n│ │  DONE   │ │IN_PROG  │ \"Implement user model\"                 │\n│ │         │ │BlueLake │                                        │\n│ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘                                        │\n│      │           │                                              │\n│      └─────┬─────┘                                              │\n│            ▼                                                    │\n│      ┌─────────┐                                                │\n│      │ BEADS-4 │ \"Add authentication endpoints\"                │\n│      │  READY  │ ← GreenCastle can start this                  │\n│      └────┬────┘                                                │\n│           │                                                     │\n│           ▼                                                     │\n│      ┌─────────┐                                                │\n│      │ BEADS-5 │ \"Integration tests for auth\"                  │\n│      │ BLOCKED │ ← Waiting on BEADS-4                          │\n│      └─────────┘                                                │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without structured task tracking, agents don't know what to work on. With Beads, they can query for ready work, understand dependencies, and update status as they progress.\n\n#### 4. BV (Beads Visualization / Bead Voyager)\n\n**What it is:** A graph-aware triage and analysis engine that sits on top of Beads. It provides intelligent recommendations about what to work on next.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Graph Analysis:** PageRank, betweenness centrality, HITS algorithm to find critical-path items\n- **Triage Recommendations:** \"Here are the 5 most impactful beads to work on now\"\n- **Blocking Analysis:** \"These 3 beads are blocking the most other work\"\n- **Quick Wins:** \"These beads are small and unblock multiple items\"\n- **Robot Mode:** JSON output for programmatic consumption by agents\n\n**Example BV triage output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    {\n      \"bead_id\": \"BEADS-4\",\n      \"title\": \"Add authentication endpoints\",\n      \"score\": 0.92,\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Unblocks 3 downstream beads\",\n        \"High PageRank (critical path)\",\n        \"Estimated 2-4 hours (reasonable scope)\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"quick_wins\": [\n    {\n      \"bead_id\": \"BEADS-7\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix typo in error messages\",\n      \"score\": 0.78,\n      \"reasons\": [\"15 minutes\", \"No dependencies\", \"Improves UX\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"blockers_to_clear\": [\n    {\n      \"bead_id\": \"BEADS-3\",\n      \"blocking_count\": 4,\n      \"assignee\": \"BlueLake\",\n      \"status\": \"in_progress\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without BV, agents pick work randomly or by recency. With BV, they work on what matters most—maximizing throughput through the dependency graph.\n\n#### 5. UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)\n\n**What it is:** A code quality and security scanning tool that catches issues before they compound.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Static Analysis:** Detect common bugs, anti-patterns, security vulnerabilities\n- **Style Enforcement:** Ensure consistency across agent-written code\n- **Complexity Metrics:** Flag overly complex functions\n- **Security Scanning:** OWASP top 10, credential leaks, injection risks\n- **Integration:** Can auto-create Beads from findings\n\n**Scan categories:**\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Security** | SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure crypto |\n| **Quality** | Dead code, unused variables, unreachable branches |\n| **Complexity** | Functions \u003e 50 lines, cyclomatic complexity \u003e 10 |\n| **Style** | Inconsistent naming, missing error handling |\n| **Performance** | N+1 queries, unbounded loops, memory leaks |\n\n**Why it matters:** Agents write code fast, but they can introduce subtle bugs. UBS catches these before they accumulate into technical debt. It's the quality gate in the flywheel.\n\n#### 6. CASS (Cross-Agent Session Search)\n\n**What it is:** A semantic search engine that indexes past agent sessions, making historical knowledge discoverable.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Session Indexing:** Every agent conversation is indexed\n- **Semantic Search:** \"How did we handle OAuth last time?\" → relevant sessions\n- **Snippet Extraction:** Pull specific relevant portions, not entire sessions\n- **Filtering:** By date, agent, project, tags, outcome (success/failure)\n- **Privacy Controls:** Redact sensitive content before indexing\n\n**Example query:**\n```\nQuery: \"rate limiting implementation\"\n\nResults:\n1. Session 2024-12-15 (GreenCastle, my-api)\n   \"Implemented token bucket rate limiter in middleware...\"\n   Relevance: 0.94\n\n2. Session 2024-11-28 (BlueLake, auth-service)\n   \"Added sliding window rate limit with Redis backend...\"\n   Relevance: 0.87\n\n3. Session 2024-10-02 (RedStone, gateway)\n   \"Considered rate limiting approaches, chose leaky bucket...\"\n   Relevance: 0.71\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without CASS, agents reinvent solutions. With CASS, they can search \"how did we solve X before?\" and build on prior work.\n\n#### 7. CM (Cass-Memory)\n\n**What it is:** A procedural memory system that extracts rules, patterns, and playbooks from CASS sessions.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Rule Extraction:** \"When doing X, always do Y\" patterns from successful sessions\n- **Anti-Pattern Detection:** \"This approach failed 3 times, avoid it\"\n- **Playbook Generation:** Step-by-step guides derived from successful sessions\n- **Context Retrieval:** \"For this task, here are relevant memories\"\n- **Privacy-Respecting:** Generalizes without exposing sensitive specifics\n\n**Example memories:**\n```yaml\n# Extracted from 47 sessions involving database migrations\n- rule: \"Always create a backup before running migrations\"\n  confidence: 0.95\n  source_sessions: 47\n\n- rule: \"Test migrations on a copy of production data\"\n  confidence: 0.89\n  source_sessions: 32\n\n- anti_pattern: \"Don't run migrations during peak traffic\"\n  failures: 3\n  description: \"Caused 2 outages when tried during business hours\"\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** CASS gives you search; CM gives you wisdom. It's the difference between \"here are past sessions\" and \"here's what we learned from them.\"\n\n#### 8. CAAM (Credential/Account Automation Manager)\n\n**What it is:** A system for managing **BYOA subscription accounts** (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) with optional BYOK (API key) support.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Profile Vault:** workspace‑local OAuth artifacts managed by CAAM (never centralized)\n- **Pool Management:** Multiple profiles per provider for rotation\n- **Auto‑Rotation:** When an account hits a limit, switch to the next profile\n- **Usage Tracking:** Track rate limits and cooldowns by profile\n- **Health Monitoring:** Detect expired tokens, rate limits, and auth failures\n\n**Example pool (profiles, not API keys):**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                   CLAUDE MAX PROFILE POOL                        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  Profile: work@corp    │ Cooldown: 12m         │ Status: ACTIVE │\n│  Profile: alice@gmail  │ Cooldown: 0m          │ Status: READY  │\n│  Profile: bob@gmail    │ Cooldown: 43m         │ Status: COOLDOWN│\n│                                                                 │\n│  Current: work@corp (active)                                    │\n│  Next: alice@gmail (auto‑rotate on rate limit)                  │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Agents consume API tokens fast. Without CAAM, you hit rate limits and stall. With CAAM, you have automatic failover across multiple keys and providers.\n\n#### 9. SLB (Safety Layer/Boundary)\n\n**What it is:** Safety guardrails that prevent dangerous operations and enforce human oversight for risky actions.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Two-Person Rule:** Dangerous operations require human approval\n- **Operation Classification:** Safe, risky, dangerous, forbidden\n- **Approval Workflows:** Request → Review → Approve/Deny\n- **Audit Trail:** Every approval decision is logged\n- **Timeout Handling:** Auto-deny if no response within window\n\n**Example dangerous operations:**\n| Operation | Risk Level | Requires |\n|-----------|------------|----------|\n| `rm -rf /` | FORBIDDEN | Blocked always |\n| `git push --force main` | DANGEROUS | Human approval |\n| `DROP TABLE users` | DANGEROUS | Human approval |\n| `git reset --hard` | RISKY | Warning + confirmation |\n| `npm install` | SAFE | Auto-approved |\n\n**Why it matters:** Autonomous agents are powerful but can make catastrophic mistakes. SLB ensures humans stay in the loop for irreversible actions.\n\n#### 10. RU (Repo Updater)\n\n**What it is:** A production-grade Bash CLI (~17,700 LOC) for managing large collections of GitHub repositories with AI-assisted review and agent automation capabilities.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Multi-repo sync:** Clone \u0026 pull 100+ repos with parallel processing (`-j N`)\n- **AI code review:** Orchestrates Claude Code sessions via ntm for PR/issue review\n- **Agent-sweep:** Three-phase automated workflow per repository (analyze → plan → execute)\n- **Conflict detection:** Identifies diverged, dirty, and conflicted repos with actionable resolution\n- **Preflight safety:** Blocks unsafe states (detached HEAD, merge in progress, secrets detected)\n\n**Agent-sweep workflow:**\n```\nPhase 1: Deep Understanding (300s)\n    ↓ Agent reads AGENTS.md, README.md, git log\nPhase 2: Plan Generation (600s)\n    ↓ Agent produces commit/release plans in structured JSON\nPhase 3: Validation \u0026 Execution (300s)\n    ↓ RU validates plans, runs preflight checks, executes git operations\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Managing dozens of repositories manually is tedious and error-prone. RU automates sync, enables AI-driven maintenance across entire repository fleets, and integrates with ntm for session orchestration.\n\n#### 11. DCG (Destructive Command Guard)\n\n**What it is:** A high-performance Rust pre-execution hook (\u003c1ms latency) for Claude Code that blocks catastrophic commands before they run.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Modular pack system:** git, filesystem, database, containers, kubernetes, cloud, terraform\n- **Context-aware:** Distinguishes executed code from data strings (dramatically reduces false positives)\n- **Severity tiers:** Critical (always block), High (allowlistable), Medium (warn), Low (log)\n- **Claude Code integration:** PreToolUse hook that intercepts Bash commands\n\n**Example blocked operations:**\n| Command | Pack | Severity |\n|---------|------|----------|\n| `git reset --hard` | core.git | Critical |\n| `rm -rf ./` | core.filesystem | Critical |\n| `docker system prune -af` | containers.docker | High |\n| `DROP DATABASE production` | database.postgresql | Critical |\n| `kubectl delete namespace prod` | kubernetes.kubectl | Critical |\n\n**Why it matters:** DCG is the mechanical enforcement layer that protects against honest mistakes. Unlike AGENTS.md instructions which agents might ignore, DCG physically prevents destructive commands from executing. It replaces simpler Python-based approaches with sub-millisecond Rust performance.\n\n#### Developer Utilities\n\nThese tools enhance AI agent workflows and should be auto-installed in agent environments:\n\n#### giil (Get Image from Internet Link)\n\n**What it is:** A zero-setup CLI that downloads full-resolution images from cloud photo sharing services.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **4-tier capture strategy:** Download button → CDN interception → element screenshot → viewport\n- **Supported platforms:** iCloud, Dropbox, Google Photos, Google Drive\n- **Image processing:** MozJPEG compression, EXIF datetime extraction, HEIC conversion\n- **Remote-friendly:** Perfect for SSH sessions where agents need to analyze screenshots\n\n**Why it matters:** When debugging UI issues remotely, agents need to see screenshots. giil bridges the gap—paste an iCloud link, run one command, agent immediately analyzes the image.\n\n#### csctf (Chat Shared Conversation to File)\n\n**What it is:** A single-binary CLI for converting public AI chat share links into clean Markdown and HTML transcripts.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Multi-provider:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude.ai\n- **Code-preserving:** Fenced blocks with language detection\n- **GitHub Pages:** One-command publish to static microsite\n- **Deterministic:** Collision-proof filenames, atomic writes\n\n**Why it matters:** AI conversations contain valuable problem-solving context. csctf captures this knowledge as searchable, archivable documents that can feed back into CASS for future retrieval.\n\n### How

All operations use CAAM for account profiles (BYOA) and API keys when needed (BYOK) → SLB for safety checks\n6. Gateway provides unified API for everything → Web UI visualizes it all\n```\n\n### The Flywheel in Action: An Example\n\nLet's walk through a concrete example of how the flywheel operates:\n\n**Scenario:** A team wants to add user authentication to their app. They have three AI agents available.\n\n```\nHOUR 0: Setup\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHuman creates beads:\n  BEADS-1: \"Design auth schema\" (ready)\n  BEADS-2: \"Implement user model\" (depends on BEADS-1)\n  BEADS-3: \"Add login endpoint\" (depends on BEADS-2)\n  BEADS-4: \"Add registration endpoint\" (depends on BEADS-2)\n  BEADS-5: \"Write auth tests\" (depends on BEADS-3, BEADS-4)\n\nBV triage recommends: \"Start with BEADS-1, it unblocks everything\"\n\nHOUR 1: First Agent Starts\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nGreenCastle (Claude Opus 4.5):\n  1. Queries BV → gets BEADS-1 as top recommendation\n  2. Claims BEADS-1 via Agent Mail\n  3. Reserves db/schema.sql via Agent Mail\n  4. Gateway spawns agent with context pack:\n     - Task: BEADS-1 description\n     - Memory: \"Always use UUID for user IDs\" (from CM)\n     - Similar session: \"Auth schema from project-X\" (from CASS)\n  5. Completes work, marks BEADS-1 done\n  6. UBS scans changes → no issues found\n\nHOUR 2: Parallel Execution Begins\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBV updates: \"BEADS-2 is now ready and high priority\"\n\nBlueLake (Codex):\n  1. Queries BV → gets BEADS-2\n  2. Claims BEADS-2, reserves src/models/user.ts\n  3. Works on user model implementation\n\nGreenCastle (now idle):\n  1. Queries BV → no ready work yet (BEADS-3,4 depend on BEADS-2)\n  2. Messages BlueLake: \"Let me know when BEADS-2 is done\"\n  3. Waits or works on unrelated beads\n\nHOUR 3: Dependencies Resolve\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBlueLake completes BEADS-2\n  → BV immediately updates: BEADS-3 and BEADS-4 are now ready\n  → Agent Mail notifies GreenCastle\n\nGreenCastle and RedStone (new agent):\n  1. GreenCastle claims BEADS-3 (login), reserves src/api/login.ts\n  2. RedStone claims BEADS-4 (registration), reserves src/api/register.ts\n  3. Both work in parallel—no conflicts because files are reserved\n\nHOUR 4: Quality Gate\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nGreenCastle completes BEADS-3\nRedStone completes BEADS-4\n\nUBS scans both:\n  - GreenCastle's code: ✅ Clean\n  - RedStone's code: ⚠️ \"SQL injection risk in email validation\"\n    → Auto-creates BEADS-6: \"Fix SQL injection in registration\"\n    → BEADS-5 now also depends on BEADS-6\n\nHOUR 5: Remediation and Completion\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRedStone fixes BEADS-6 (quick win, 10 minutes)\nUBS re-scans: ✅ Clean\n\nBV: \"BEADS-5 (auth tests) is now ready\"\n\nBlueLake claims BEADS-5, writes comprehensive tests\nAll tests pass → Feature complete!\n\nHOUR 6: Knowledge Capture\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCASS indexes all 5 sessions from this sprint\n\nCM extracts new rules:\n  - \"Use parameterized queries for email validation\"\n  - \"Include rate limiting on registration endpoints\"\n  - \"Auth schemas should include created_at/updated_at\"\n\nNext time any agent works on authentication:\n  → These rules appear in their context pack\n  → They don't repeat the SQL injection mistake\n  → The flywheel has improved\n```\n\n### The Philosophy: Why This Approach?\n\nSeveral philosophical principles guide the Agent Flywheel design:\n\n#### 1. Agents as First-Class Citizens\n\nTraditional tooling treats AI as an afterthought—\"maybe we'll add an API later.\" The flywheel treats agents as **primary users**:\n- Every operation has a REST API\n- OpenAPI specs include agent-specific hints\n- Error messages are designed to be actionable by agents\n- The system is observable and introspectable\n\n#### 2. Coordination Over Control\n\nRather than trying to \"control\" agents with rigid rules, we focus on **coordination**:\n- File reservations are advisory, not mandatory\n- Agents can message each other to resolve conflicts\n- The system provides information; agents make decisions\n\n#### 3. Memory as Infrastructure\n\nKnowledge shouldn't be trapped in individual sessions:\n- CASS makes all sessions searchable\n- CM extracts generalizable knowledge\n- Context packs deliver relevant memories at the right time\n- The system gets smarter with every session\n\n#### 4. Safety Through Visibility\n\nRather than trying to prevent all mistakes (impossible), we focus on:\n- Making agent activity visible (Gateway UI)\n- Catching issues early (UBS scanning)\n- Requiring approval for dangerous operations (SLB)\n- Maintaining audit trails for review\n\n#### 5. self-managed and Control\n\nThe flywheel is designed to run on your infrastructure:\n- No vendor lock-in; BYOA (Bring Your Own Account) with optional BYOK (API keys)\n- All data stays on your servers\n- Open protocols (MCP, ACP) for interoperability\n- Can run on cheap bare-metal (any VPS or dedicated server provider)\n\n### How to Read This Document\n\nThis plan document (PLAN.md) covers the **technical architecture** of Flywheel Gateway.\n\n**PLAN.md structure:**\n- §1-2: Vision, outcomes, philosophy\n- §3-4: Technology stack and architecture overview\n- §5-7: Core systems (supervisor, drivers, lifecycle)\n- §8-9: API and WebSocket layers\n- §10-21: Feature-by-feature specifications (each flywheel tool)\n- §22-23: UI/UX design\n- §24-26: Security, testing, risks\n- §27-30: Implementation phases and file structure\n- Appendix: API reference tables\n\n**Key terminology:**\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **Agent** | An AI coding assistant (Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.) |\n| **Session** | A single conversation/task execution with an agent |\n| **Bead** | A unit of work (task, bug, feature) |\n| **Context Pack** | Pre-assembled prompt with triage, memory, search results |\n| **Driver** | Backend for agent execution (SDK, ACP, Tmux) |\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:56:50.147034625-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-08T20:50:10.161890877-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T19:56:55.185989264-05:00","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.1","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:56:50.149501953-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
{"id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.10","title":"PLAN: 6. Agent Driver Abstraction","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead embeds the `docs/PLAN.md` section **\"6.

Tmux Driver supports users who want visual terminal access:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/agent-drivers/src/tmux/driver.ts\n\nexport class TmuxDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly type = 'tmux' as const;\n\n  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise\u003cAgent\u003e {\n    const sessionName = `flywheel-${Date.now()}`;\n\n    // Create tmux session\n    await $`tmux new-session -d -s

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.11","title":"PLAN: 7. Agent Lifecycle Management","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead embeds the `docs/PLAN.md` section **\"7. Agent Lifecycle Management\"** verbatim so Beads remains self-contained.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The embedded content below matches the corresponding section in `docs/PLAN.md`.\n\n## Embedded Content\n\n## 7. Agent Lifecycle Management\n\n### 7.1 Activity States\n\n```typescript\ntype ActivityState =\n  | 'idle'           // Waiting for input\n  | 'thinking'       // Processing, no output yet\n  | 'working'        // Actively producing output\n  | 'tool_calling'   // Executing a tool\n  | 'waiting_input'  // Waiting for user input\n  | 'error'          // Encountered an error\n  | 'stalled';       // No activity for threshold period\n\ninterface ActivityStatus {\n  agentId: string;\n  state: ActivityState;\n  since: Date;\n  duration: number;  // ms in current state\n  lastOutput?: Date;\n  lastToolCall?: {\n    name: string;\n    startedAt: Date;\n  };\n  healthScore: number;  // 0-100\n}\n```\n\n### 7.2 Activity Detection (SDK Driver)\n\nFor SDK-based agents, activity detection is straightforward via events:\n\n```typescript\nclass SDKActivityDetector {\n  detectState(events: AgentEvent[]): ActivityState {\n    const recent = events.slice(-10);\n\n    if (recent.some(e =\u003e e.type === 'error')) {\n      return 'error';\n    }\n\n    if (recent.some(e =\u003e e.type === 'tool_call' \u0026\u0026 !e.completed)) {\n      return 'tool_calling';\n    }\n\n    const lastOutput = recent.findLast(e =\u003e e.type === 'output');\n    if (lastOutput \u0026\u0026 Date.now() - lastOutput.timestamp.getTime() \u003c 5000) {\n      return 'working';\n    }\n\n    const lastActivity = recent[recent.length - 1];\n    if (lastActivity \u0026\u0026 Date.now() - lastActivity.timestamp.getTime() \u003e 5 * 60 * 1000) {\n      return 'stalled';\n    }\n\n    return 'idle';\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7.3 Checkpoints\n\nAgents can go off-track. Checkpoints allow rolling back to a known-good state.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Checkpoint {\n  id: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  name?: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  createdBy: 'user' | 'auto' | 'agent';\n  trigger: 'manual' | 'scheduled' | 'before_risky_op' | 'milestone';\n\n  // Captured state\n  conversationHistory: Message[];\n  toolState: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e;\n  workingDirectory: string;\n  fileSnapshot: FileSnapshot[];  // Modified files since session start\n  contextPack?: ContextPack;\n\n  // Metadata\n  description?: string;\n  tags: string[];\n  size: number;  // bytes\n  verified: boolean;\n  verifiedAt?: Date;\n\n  // Delta chain metadata (for progressive checkpointing)\n  checkpointType: 'full' | 'delta';\n  parentId?: string;           // For delta checkpoints\n  deltaDepth?: number;         // How many deltas to traverse\n  fullCheckpointId?: string;   // Nearest full checkpoint in chain\n}\n\ninterface FileSnapshot {\n  path: string;\n  content: string;\n  hash: string;\n  mtime: Date;\n}\n```\n\n#### 7.3.1 Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing\n\nInstead of full snapshots for each checkpoint, store only what changed since the last checkpoint—dramatically reducing storage costs and restore times.\n\n**The Problem with Full Checkpoints:**\n\nFor a 2-hour agent session with 50 modified files, each checkpoint could be 10-50MB. With auto-checkpoints every 30 minutes, that's 4+ checkpoints = 200MB per session. Across many agents and sessions, storage explodes.\n\n**Delta Checkpoint Model:**\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/checkpoint.ts\n\ninterface DeltaCheckpoint extends Checkpoint {\n  checkpointType: 'delta';\n  parentId: string;              // Required for deltas\n\n  // Only what changed since parent\n  delta: {\n    newConversationTurns: Message[];           // Only new turns\n    modifiedToolState: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e; // Only changed keys\n    fileDeltas: FileDelta[];                   // Git-style diffs\n  };\n\n  // Chain metadata for fast restore\n  chain: {\n    depth: number;              // How many checkpoints in chain\n    fullCheckpointId: string;   // Nearest full checkpoint\n    totalSize: number;          // Sum of chain sizes\n  };\n}\n\ninterface FileDelta {\n  path: string;\n  type: 'created' | 'modified' | 'deleted';\n  diff?: string;                // Unified diff for modifications\n  content?: string;             // Full content for created files\n  previousHash?: string;        // For verification\n}\n\ninterface FullCheckpoint extends Checkpoint {\n  checkpointType: 'full';\n  // Contains complete state (no deltas)\n}\n```\n\n**Compaction Strategy:**\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/services/checkpoint.service.ts\n\nexport class CheckpointService {\n  private readonly FULL_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL = 5; // Every 5th is full\n\n  async createCheckpoint(agentId: string, trigger: string): Promise\u003cCheckpoint\u003e {\n    const lastCheckpoint = await this.getLastCheckpoint(agentId);\n    const deltaDepth = lastCheckpoint?.deltaDepth ??

Rather than reacting after problems occur, the Auto-Healing system **proactively** manages context pressure through graduated interventions.\n\n#### 7.6.1 Health Thresholds \u0026 Actions\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/services/context-health.service.ts\n\ninterface ContextHealthConfig {\n  warningThreshold: 0.75;     // 75% → start preparing summary\n  criticalThreshold: 0.85;    // 85% → auto-compact\n  emergencyThreshold: 0.95;   // 95% → force checkpoint + rotate\n\n  // Predictive settings\n  enablePrediction: boolean;\n  predictionWindowMs: number; // Look-ahead window for exhaustion prediction\n  consumptionSampleSize: number; // Turns to sample for rate estimation\n}\n\nexport class ContextHealthService {\n  private summaryCache = new Map\u003cstring, PreparedSummary\u003e();\n\n  async monitorAgent(agentId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    const context = await this.getContextWindow(agentId);\n    const health = this.assessHealth(context);\n\n    switch (health.status) {\n      case 'healthy':\n        // No action needed, but start predictive monitoring\n        this.updatePrediction(agentId, context);\n        break;\n\n      case 'warning':\n        // Proactively prepare summary for instant swap-in\n        await this.prepareSummary(agentId);\n        this.emitEvent('context.warning', { agentId, utilization: context.utilizationPercent });\n        break;\n\n      case 'critical':\n        // Auto-compact: replace old turns with prepared summary\n        await this.autoCompact(agentId);\n        this.emitEvent('context.compacted', { agentId, freedTokens: health.freedTokens });\n        break;\n\n      case 'emergency':\n        // Force checkpoint and rotate to fresh agent\n        await this.emergencyRotate(agentId);\n        this.emitEvent('context.emergency_rotated', { agentId });\n        break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  private async prepareSummary(agentId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    if (this.summaryCache.has(agentId)) return;\n\n    const history = await this.getConversationHistory(agentId);\n    const oldTurns = history.slice(0, -10); // Keep last 10 turns intact\n\n    // Use a fast model to summarize older turns\n    const summary = await this.summarizeService.summarize(oldTurns, {\n      maxTokens: 500,\n      preserveKeyDecisions: true,\n      preserveFileChanges: true,\n    });\n\n    this.summaryCache.set(agentId, {\n      summary,\n      turnsReplaced: oldTurns.length,\n      preparedAt: new Date(),\n    });\n  }\n\n  private async autoCompact(agentId: string): Promise\u003cCompactionResult\u003e {\n    const prepared = this.summaryCache.get(agentId);\n    if (!prepared) {\n      await this.prepareSummary(agentId);\n    }\n\n    // Atomically swap old turns for summary\n    const result = await this.agentService.replaceHistoryWithSummary(\n      agentId,\n      prepared.summary,\n      prepared.turnsReplaced\n    );\n\n    this.summaryCache.delete(agentId);\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  private async emergencyRotate(agentId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    // 1.

This requires more than just messaging—it requires a structured transfer of context, state, and resources.\n\n**The Problem Without Structured Handoffs:**\n1. Agent A finishes part 1 and updates a bead\n2. Human notices\n3. Human spawns Agent B\n4. Human crafts a prompt explaining the context (often incomplete)\n\n**With the Handoff Protocol:**\n1. Agent A initiates handoff: \"Hey BlueLake, I've completed the API schema. Your turn for frontend integration.\"\n2. BlueLake automatically receives: task context, relevant conversation history, modified files, and continuation prompt\n3.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.13","title":"PLAN: 8. REST API Layer","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead embeds the `docs/PLAN.md` section **\"8. REST API Layer\"** verbatim so Beads remains self-contained.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The embedded content below matches the corresponding section in `docs/PLAN.md`.\n\n## Embedded Content\n\n## 8. REST API Layer\n\n### 8.1 API Design Philosophy\n\nThe REST API follows these principles:\n\n1. **Resource-oriented** — Agents, beads, reservations, messages as resources\n2. **Consistent responses** — All responses follow a standard envelope\n3. **Idempotent where possible** — PUT/DELETE operations are idempotent\n4. **Rich error responses** — Error codes, messages, and actionable hints\n5. **AI-agent friendly** — Comprehensive examples for LLM consumption\n\n### 8.2 Base URL Structure\n\n```\nProduction:  https://api.flywheel.local/v1\nDevelopment: http://localhost:8080/api/v1\n```\n\n### 8.3 API Conventions\n\n**Content types:**\n- Requests: `application/json`\n- Responses: `application/json`\n\n**Pagination:**\n```\n?limit=50\u0026cursor=cursor_01H...\n```\n\n**Filtering:**\n```\n?model=claude\u0026status=working\n```\n\n**Sorting:**\n```\n?sort=-updated_at\n```\n\n### 8.4 Idempotency Framework\n\nAgents may retry requests. Without idempotency, this could spawn duplicate agents, send duplicate prompts, or create duplicate checkpoints.\n\n**Idempotency Header:**\nFor any POST that mutates state, accept:\n- `Idempotency-Key: \u003cuuid\u003e` header\n- Server stores key + result for a TTL window\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts\n\nconst idempotencyStore = new Map\u003cstring, StoredResult\u003e();\n\ninterface StoredResult {\n  response: unknown;\n  statusCode: number;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n}\n\nexport async function idempotencyMiddleware(c: Context, next: Next) {\n  const idempotencyKey = c.req.header('Idempotency-Key');\n\n  if (!idempotencyKey) {\n    return next();\n  }\n\n  // Check for existing result\n  const existing = idempotencyStore.get(idempotencyKey);\n  if (existing \u0026\u0026 existing.expiresAt \u003e new Date()) {\n    return c.json(existing.response, existing.statusCode);\n  }\n\n  // Execute and store\n  await next();\n\n  const response = await c.res.json();\n  idempotencyStore.set(idempotencyKey, {\n    response,\n    statusCode: c.res.status,\n    createdAt: new Date(),\n    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24h TTL\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 8.4.1 Provisioning API (Queue‑Driven)\n\nProvisioning is a first‑class REST resource. All state changes flow through the queue API.\n\n**Create request:**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests\nIdempotency-Key: \u003cuuid\u003e\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"workspace_id\": \"workspace-abc123\",\n  \"capacity_profile_id\": \"profile-standard\",\n  \"provider_id\": \"provider-a\",\n  \"region\": \"eu-central\",\n  \"email_verified_at\": \"2026-01-08T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"onboarding_mode\": \"manual\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"prov_01HXYZ\",\n    \"state\": \"pending\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2026-01-08T00:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Transition request (explicit from/to):**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests/{id}/transition\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"from\": \"approved\",\n  \"to\": \"provisioned\",\n  \"reason\": \"manual_approval_complete\"\n}\n```\n\n**Allowed transitions:**\n- `pending → approved`\n- `approved → provisioned`\n- `provisioned → verified`\n- `verified → assigned`\n- Any state → `failed` (with reason)\n- `pending/approved` → `expired`\n- `failed` → `pending` (retry)\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- `pending → approved` requires `email_verified_at`.\n- `pending → approved` requires manual approval when `onboarding_mode=manual`.\n\n**Verification report:**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests/{id}/verify\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"checks\": {\n    \"disk_io\": \"pass\",\n    \"network_latency_ms\": 18,\n    \"container_health\": \"pass\",\n    \"monitoring_agent\": \"pass\",\n    \"caam_ready\": \"pass\"\n  },\n  \"notes\": \"Initial verification complete\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assignment (BYOA gated):**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests/{id}/assign\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"requires_byoa\": true,\n  \"min_providers\": 1\n}\n```\n\nIf BYOA is not verified, the API returns `BYOA_REQUIRED`.\n\n### 8.5 Error Model \u0026 Taxonomy\n\nAll errors follow a consistent structure with semantic error codes and HTTP status mappings:\n\n```typescript\ninterface ApiError {\n  error: {\n    code: ErrorCode;                    // Semantic error code\n    message: string;                    // Human-readable description\n    details?: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e;  // Additional context\n    request_id: string;                 // For support/debugging\n    hint?: string;                      // Suggested fix for AI agents\n    docs_url?: string;                  // Link to relevant documentation\n  };\n}\n```\n\n#### Error Code Taxonomy\n\nErrors are organized into categories with consistent HTTP status mappings:\n\n| Category | Code Pattern | HTTP Status | Description |\n|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Resource** | `*_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource doesn't exist |\n| **Resource** | `*_ALREADY_EXISTS` | 409 | Resource already exists |\n| **Validation** | `INVALID_*` | 400 | Request validation failed |\n| **Validation** | `MISSING_*` | 400 | Required field missing |\n| **Auth** | `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Not authenticated |\n| **Auth** | `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Not authorized for action |\n| **Quota** | `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | 429 | Rate/usage limit hit |\n| **Quota** | `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests |\n| **State** | `*_IN_PROGRESS` | 409 | Conflicting operation |\n| **State** | `*_NOT_READY` | 503 | Resource not ready |\n| **Dependency** | `*_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Dependency down |\n| **Internal** | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error |\n\n#### Complete Error Code Reference\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/errors/codes.ts\n\nexport const ErrorCodes = {\n  // Agent errors\n

These return a job ID immediately, with status polling.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Job {\n  id: string;\n  type: string;\n  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';\n  progress?: number;  // 0-100\n  createdAt: Date;\n  startedAt?: Date;\n  completedAt?: Date;\n  result?: unknown;\n  error?: string;\n  metadata?: Record\u003cstring, unknown\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n**Jobs REST Endpoints:**\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/jobs` | List jobs |\n| `GET` | `/jobs/{id}` | Get job status |\n| `DELETE` | `/jobs/{id}` | Cancel job |\n| `GET` | `/jobs/{id}/result` | Get job result |\n\n**Jobs WebSocket Events:**\n\n```typescript\ninterface JobEvent {\n  type: 'job.started' | 'job.progress' | 'job.completed' | 'job.failed';\n  data: {\n    jobId: string;\n    status: Job['status'];\n    progress?: number;\n    result?: unknown;\n    error?: string;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 8.8 OpenAPI \u0026 Developer Experience\n\nThe API is self-documenting for both humans and AI agents.\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/openapi/generator.ts\n\nimport { generateOpenApi } from '@hono/zod-openapi';\n\nexport const openApiSpec = generateOpenApi(app, {\n  openapi: '3.1.0',\n  info: {\n    title: 'Flywheel Gateway API',\n    version: '1.0.0',\n    description: 'Multi-agent orchestration platform API',\n  },\n  servers: [\n    { url: 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1', description: 'Development' },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n**AI-Agent Hints:**\n\nEvery endpoint includes hints for AI consumers:\n\n```typescript\ninterface EndpointHints {\n  summary: string;              // What this does\n  whenToUse: string;           // When an agent should call this\n  commonMistakes: string[];    // What to avoid\n  relatedEndpoints: string[];  // What to call next\n  exampleScenarios: string[];  // Real use cases\n}\n```\n\n**Swagger UI:** Available at `/docs` with interactive testing, request/response examples, authentication helper, and WebSocket documentation.\n\n### 8.9 Core Endpoint Categories\n\n#### System (`/api/v1/...`)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |\n| `GET` | `/version` | Version info |\n| `GET` | `/capabilities` | Available features |\n| `GET` | `/doctor` | Tool health check |\n\n#### Agents (`/api/v1/agents`)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/agents` | List all agents |\n| `POST` | `/agents` | Spawn new agent |\n| `GET` | `/agents/{id}` | Get agent details |\n| `DELETE` | `/agents/{id}` | Terminate agent |\n| `POST` | `/agents/{id}/send` | Send prompt |\n| `POST` | `/agents/{id}/interrupt` | Interrupt agent |\n| `GET` | `/agents/{id}/output` | Get output |\n| `GET` | `/agents/{id}/status` | Get status |\n| `POST` | `/agents/{id}/checkpoint` | Create checkpoint |\n\n### 8.10 Golden Path: API Sequence for AI Agents\n\nThis section demonstrates the **ideal API call sequence** for an AI agent orchestrating work. Agents consuming the OpenAPI spec should follow this pattern for reliable operation.\n\n#### Scenario: Spawn Agent, Coordinate, Execute Task\n\n```typescript\n// Step 1: Check system health and capabilities\nconst capabilities = await fetch('/api/v1/capabilities').then(r =\u003e r.json());\n// → Verify required features are available\n\n// Step 2: Check for ready work (if using Beads)\nconst triage = await fetch('/api/v1/beads/triage').then(r =\u003e r.json());\n// → Get prioritized recommendations: triage.data.recommendations\n\n// Step 3: Claim work to prevent conflicts\nconst bead = await fetch('/api/v1/beads/beads-123', {\n  method: 'PATCH',\n  body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'in_progress', assignee: 'GreenCastle' }),\n}).then(r =\u003e r.json());\n\n// Step 4: Reserve files before starting work\nconst reservation = await fetch('/api/v1/reservations', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    paths: ['src/api/users.ts', 'src/api/users.test.ts'],\n    agent: 'GreenCastle',\n    exclusive: true,\n    ttl_seconds: 3600,\n  }),\n}).then(r =\u003e r.json());\n\n// Check for conflicts\nif (reservation.data.conflicts.length \u003e 0) {\n  // Coordinate via Agent Mail or wait\n  console.log('Conflict with:', reservation.data.conflicts[0].holder);\n}\n\n// Step 5: Build context pack for the task\nconst contextPack = await fetch('/api/v1/context/build', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    taskDescription: bead.data.title,\n    components: {\n      triage: { budget: 2000, enabled: true },\n      memory: { budget: 3000, enabled: true },\n      cass: { budget: 2000, enabled: true },\n    },\n  }),\n}).then(r =\u003e r.json());\n\n// Step 6: Spawn the agent\nconst agent = await fetch('/api/v1/agents', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    model: 'claude',\n    workingDir: '/path/to/project',\n    contextPack: contextPack.data.id,\n  }),\n}).then(r =\u003e r.json());\n\n// Step 7: Subscribe to output via WebSocket\nconst ws = new WebSocket('/api/v1/ws');\nws.send(JSON.stringify({\n  op: 'subscribe',\n  topics: [`output:${agent.data.id}`, `agents:${agent.data.id}`],\n}));\n\n// Step 8: Send the task prompt\nawait fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}/send`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    prompt: `Complete this task: ${bead.data.title}\\n\\n${bead.data.description}`,\n  }),\n});\n\n// Step 9: Monitor for completion (via WebSocket events)\nws.onmessage = (event) =\u003e {\n  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);\n  if (msg.type === 'agent.state_changed' \u0026\u0026 msg.data.state === 'idle') {\n    // Agent finished\n    handleCompletion();\n  }\n};\n\n// Step 10: On completion, create checkpoint and release resources\nasync function handleCompletion() {\n  // Create checkpoint before cleanup\n  await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}/checkpoint`, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: JSON.stringify({ reason: 'task_complete' }),\n  });\n\n  // Release file reservations\n  await fetch('/api/v1/reservations', {\n    method: 'DELETE',\n    body: JSON.stringify({ agent: 'GreenCastle' }),\n  });\n\n  // Close the bead\n  await fetch('/api/v1/beads/beads-123/close', { method: 'POST' });\n\n  // Terminate agent (or keep for next task)\n  await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });\n}\n```\n\n#### Error Handling Pattern\n\n```typescript\nasync function safeApiCall\u003cT\u003e(\n  url: string,\n  options?: RequestInit\n): Promise\u003c{ data?: T; error?: ApiError }\u003e {\n  const response = await fetch(url, options);\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const error = await response.json();\n\n    // Handle specific recoverable errors\n    switch (error.error.code) {\n      case 'QUOTA_EXCEEDED':\n        // Rotate to different account and retry\n        await fetch('/api/v1/accounts/pools/default/rotate', { method: 'POST' });\n        return safeApiCall(url, options);\n\n      case 'RESERVATION_CONFLICT':\n        // Wait and retry, or coordinate via mail\n        await sleep(30000);\n        return safeApiCall(url, options);\n\n      case 'AGENT_BUSY':\n        // Wait for agent to finish current operation\n        await sleep(5000);\n        return safeApiCall(url, options);\n\n      default:\n        return { error: error.error };\n    }\n  }\n\n  return { data: (await response.json()).data };\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Principles for Agent Consumers\n\n1. **Always check capabilities first** — Don't assume features exist\n2. **Reserve before editing** — Prevent file conflicts\n3. **Use context packs** — Give agents situational awareness\n4. **Subscribe to WebSocket early** — Don't miss events\n5. **Create checkpoints** — Enable recovery on failure\n6. **Clean up resources** — Release reservations, close beads\n7. **Handle errors gracefully** — Many errors are recoverable\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:50.879506316-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-08T20:50:15.197084031-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:55.914622363-05:00","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.13","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:50.880828097-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

Falls back to alternative notification (email, webhook)\n\n#### Missed Message Detection\n\nClients detect gaps in sequence numbers:\n\n```typescript\nclass ReliableWebSocket {\n  private lastSeq = new Map\u003cstring, number\u003e();\n\n  handleMessage(event: ReliableEvent) {\n    const lastSeen = this.lastSeq.get(event.topic) ?? 0;\n\n    if (event.seq \u003e lastSeen + 1) {\n      // Gap detected - request replay\n      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({\n        op: 'replay',\n        topic: event.topic,\n        from_seq: lastSeen + 1,\n        to_seq: event.seq - 1,\n      }));\n    }\n\n    this.lastSeq.set(event.topic, event.seq);\n    this.processEvent(event);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9.9 Scale-Out Architecture\n\nFor high-availability deployments with multiple gateway instances, WebSocket connections are distributed across servers with shared state.\n\n#### Redis Adapter Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/ws/redis-adapter.ts\n\nimport { Redis } from 'ioredis';\n\ninterface ScaleOutConfig {\n  mode: 'single' | 'redis' | 'cluster';\n  redis?: {\n    url: string;\n    keyPrefix: string;\n  };\n}\n\nexport class RedisWebSocketAdapter {\n  private pub: Redis;\n  private sub: Redis;\n\n  constructor(private config: ScaleOutConfig) {\n    if (config.mode === 'redis') {\n      this.pub = new Redis(config.redis!.url);\n      this.sub = new Redis(config.redis!.url);\n      this.setupSubscriptions();\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Broadcast to all servers\n  async broadcast(topic: string, event: WebSocketEvent): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n    if (this.config.mode === 'single') {\n      // Direct broadcast to local connections\n      this.localHub.broadcast(topic, event);\n    } else {\n      // Publish to Redis, all servers receive and broadcast locally\n      await this.pub.publish(\n        `${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:${topic}`,\n        JSON.stringify(event)\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  private setupSubscriptions() {\n    this.sub.psubscribe(`${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:*`);\n\n    this.sub.on('pmessage', (pattern, channel, message) =\u003e {\n      const topic = channel.replace(`${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:`, '');\n      const event = JSON.parse(message);\n      this.localHub.broadcast(topic, event);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Sticky Sessions\n\nFor WebSocket connections, use sticky sessions to route reconnecting clients to the same server:\n\n```typescript\n// Connection ID encodes server affinity\ninterface ConnectionId {\n  serverId: string;    // e.g., 'gateway-1'\n  connectionId: string; // UUID\n  createdAt: number;\n}\n\n// Load balancer uses X-Server-Id header for routing\nfunction generateConnectionId(serverId: string): string {\n  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({\n    serverId,\n    connectionId: crypto.randomUUID(),\n    createdAt: Date.now(),\n  })).toString('base64url');\n}\n```\n\n#### Horizontal Scaling Topology\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                       LOAD BALANCER                                  │\n│                  (Sticky sessions by connection ID)                  │\n└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                            │\n        ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐\n        │                   │                   │\n        ▼                   ▼                   ▼\n┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐\n│  Gateway 1    │   │  Gateway 2    │   │  Gateway 3    │\n│  (WebSocket)  │   │  (WebSocket)  │   │  (WebSocket)  │\n└───────┬───────┘   └───────┬───────┘   └───────┬───────┘\n        │                   │                   │\n        └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘\n                            │\n                    ┌───────▼───────┐\n                    │    Redis      │\n                    │  (Pub/Sub)    │\n                    └───────────────┘\n                            │\n                    ┌───────▼───────┐\n                    │   SQLite /    │\n                    │   Postgres    │\n                    └───────────────┘\n```\n\n**Scaling Guidelines:**\n\n| Metric | Single Server | Redis Mode | Notes |\n|--------|---------------|------------|-------|\n| Connections | ~10,000 | ~100,000+ | Per gateway instance |\n| Events/sec | ~50,000 | ~500,000 | Aggregate across cluster |\n| Latency | \u003c10ms | \u003c50ms | Pub/sub adds overhead |\n| Complexity | Low | Medium | Redis operational burden |\n\n**Recommendation:** Start with single-server mode.

Context Pack Building Engine\n\n### 10.1 The \"Brain\" of the Flywheel\n\nContext packs are pre-assembled prompts that give agents situational awareness. They combine:\n- **Triage data** (from BV) — What work is ready, blocked, recommended\n- **Memory** (from CM) — Relevant rules, anti-patterns, past solutions\n- **Search results** (from CASS) — Similar past sessions\n- **Session context** (from S2P) — Recent conversation history\n\n### 10.2 Token Budget Allocation\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/context.ts\n\ninterface

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.21","title":"PLAN: 16. CAAM Account \u0026 Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead embeds the `docs/PLAN.md` section **\"16. CAAM Account \u0026 Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)\"** verbatim so Beads remains self-contained.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The embedded content below matches the corresponding section in `docs/PLAN.md`.\n\n## Embedded Content\n\n## 16. CAAM Account \u0026 Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)\n\nCAAM (Coding Agent Account Manager) is the **account/profile orchestration layer** for Flywheel Gateway. It is designed for **BYOA (Bring Your Own Account)** subscription logins by default, with optional **BYOK (API key)** support for advanced automation use cases.\n\n**Non‑negotiable security invariant:** OAuth credentials are never stored in Gateway’s central database. All auth artifacts live inside each workspace's isolated environment, managed by CAAM. Gateway only stores **non‑sensitive metadata** (presence, hashes, timestamps, health).\n\n### 16.1 Principles\n\n1. **BYOA first** — subscription accounts (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) are the default path.\n2. **No credential custody** — Gateway never sees Google/Anthropic/OpenAI logins or passwords.\n3. **workspace‑local auth artifacts** — tokens remain inside the workspace container/volume.\n4. **Minimum requirement** — at least one verified provider to activate/assign; recommended: 1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro.\n5. **Provider parity** — Claude, Codex, and Gemini are all supported.\n6. **Autonomous rotation** — cooldown + rotation is automated via CAAM.\n\n### 16.2 Account \u0026 Profile Data Model\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/accounts.ts\n\ntype ProviderId = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\ntype AuthMode = 'oauth_browser' | 'device_code' | 'api_key';\n\ninterface AccountProfile {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  name: string;               // Profile label (e.g., \"work\", \"alice@gmail.com\")\n  authMode: AuthMode;\n\n  // Status \u0026 health (no secrets)\n  status: 'unlinked' | 'linked' | 'verified' | 'expired' | 'cooldown' | 'error';\n  statusMessage?: string;\n  lastVerifiedAt?: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;           // If known from token metadata\n  cooldownUntil?: Date;\n  lastUsedAt?: Date;\n  healthScore?: number;       // 0..100\n\n  // Auth artifacts (metadata only)\n  artifacts: {\n    authFilesPresent: boolean;\n    authFileHash?: string;    // hash of auth artifact for change detection\n    storageMode?: 'file' | 'keyring' | 'unknown';\n  };\n\n  labels?: string[];\n  createdAt: Date;\n  updatedAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AccountPool {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  profileIds: string[];\n  rotationStrategy: 'smart' | 'round_robin' | 'least_recent' | 'random';\n  cooldownMinutesDefault: number;\n  maxRetries: number;\n}\n\ninterface workspaceAuthState {\n  workspaceId: string;\n  byoaStatus: 'unlinked' | 'pending' | 'verified' | 'failed';\n  verifiedProviders: ProviderId[];\n  lastCheckedAt?: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### 16.3 CAAM Integration Architecture\n\nCAAM runs **inside each workspace container**. Gateway interacts with it via a thin runner interface:\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/caam/runner.ts\n\ninterface LoginChallenge {\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  mode: 'device_code' | 'oauth_url' | 'local_browser' | 'manual_copy';\n  code?: string;              // For device code\n  verificationUrl?: string;   // For device code\n  loginUrl?: string;          // For browser OAuth\n  instructions?: string;      // Human-readable fallback\n  expiresInSeconds?: number;\n}\n\ninterface CaamRunner {\n  listProfiles(workspaceId: string): Promise\u003cAccountProfile[]\u003e;\n  getStatus(workspaceId: string, provider?: ProviderId): Promise\u003cworkspaceAuthState\u003e;\n  startLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId, mode?: AuthMode): Promise\u003cLoginChallenge\u003e;\n  completeLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId): Promise\u003c{ status: 'linked' | 'failed' }\u003e;\n  activateProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  runWithProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, command: string[]): Promise\u003cExecResult\u003e;\n  setCooldown(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, minutes: number, reason?: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- CAAM is the source of truth for auth artifacts.\n- Gateway records only metadata (status, hashes, timestamps).\n- Rotation happens at runtime by selecting the healthiest profile.\n- Runner implementation should wrap the `caam` CLI from `/data/projects/coding_agent_account_manager` and keep auth paths aligned with `caam paths` output.\n- CAAM enforces Codex file-based storage by writing `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `config.toml` within the profile's `CODEX_HOME`.\n\n### 16.4 Provider Auth Flows (BYOA)\n\n**Generic BYOA linking flow:**\n1. Gateway calls CAAM `startLogin` for the workspace/provider.\n2. UI displays device code or OAuth URL to the user.\n3. User completes auth on their own machine.\n4. CAAM detects new auth artifacts locally and marks profile `verified`.\n5. Gateway pulls metadata only (status, hashes, timestamps).\n\n**Codex (GPT Pro)**\n- Standard login: `codex login` (local browser flow).\n- Device code login: `codex login --device-auth` (headless-friendly).\n- Auth cache stored in `~/.codex/auth.json`; CAAM enforces file mode by writing `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `config.toml`.\n- CAAM uses `CODEX_HOME` to isolate profiles per agent.\n\n**Claude Code (Claude Max)**\n- Login is initiated in CLI via `/login`.\n- Credentials are stored locally by the CLI; file locations can change between releases.\n- CAAM detects the **actual** auth artifacts and records hashes.\n- API key mode is supported via `~/.claude/settings.json` with `apiKeyHelper`.\n\n**Gemini CLI**\n- Settings live in `~/.gemini/settings.json` or project `.gemini/settings.json`.\n- Auth modes: Google login, API key, or Vertex AI; `/auth` switches the method.\n- Headless containers use API key or Vertex AI (browserless).\n\n**BYOK reference (pi-mono):**\n- API key mode uses environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n- Gateway should map workspace secrets into these env vars when BYOK is enabled.\n\n#### 16.4.1 Auth Artifact Discovery \u0026 Normalization\n\nCAAM does **not** hardcode auth file paths as the source of truth. It discovers and normalizes artifacts at runtime and stores **metadata only** (hash + timestamps) in Gateway.\n\n| Provider | Typical Auth Artifacts (workspace‑local) | Isolation Anchor | Notes |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| **Codex** | `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) | `HOME`, `CODEX_HOME` | CAAM enforces `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `config.toml`. |\n| **Claude** | `~/.claude.json`, `~/.config/claude-code/auth.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json` | `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | API key mode uses `settings.json` (apiKeyHelper). |\n| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/settings.json` (or project `.gemini/settings.json`), `~/.gemini/.env` | `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | OAuth or API key mode; settings location is stable. |\n\n**Normalization rules:**\n- Track only hashes + modified timestamps (never contents).\n- If multiple artifacts exist, prefer the most recently modified set.\n- Any auth artifact change invalidates prior health score until re‑verified.\n\n#### 16.4.2 Login Modes (Provider‑Aware)\n\n**Device Code (Codex):**\n- CAAM starts device auth and returns a verification URL + code.\n- UI shows code, button to open URL, and progress indicator.\n\n**Browser OAuth (Codex default, Gemini):**\n- CAAM emits a login URL detected from CLI output.\n- User opens URL on their own machine and completes login.\n\n**Slash Command (Claude Code):**\n- User runs `/login` in the CLI; CAAM waits for new auth artifacts.\n\n**API Key / ADC (Gemini, Claude):**\n- Gemini: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `.gemini/.env`) or use Vertex ADC.\n- Claude: apiKeyHelper in `~/.claude/settings.json` (no OAuth artifacts).\n\n**Manual Copy (Codex fallback):**\n- User logs in on their own machine.\n- Copy `~/.codex/auth.json` into the workspace via a secure upload path.\n- CAAM records the hash and marks the profile verified (no cookies stored centrally).\n\nExample response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"provider\": \"codex\",\n  \"mode\": \"device_code\",\n  \"code\": \"B7QZ-4NJD\",\n  \"verificationUrl\": \"https://example.com/activate\",\n  \"expiresInSeconds\": 900\n}\n```\n\n#### 16.4.3 BYOA Verification Rules\n\nVerification is **local, artifact‑based**, and avoids network calls by default:\n\n1. Auth artifacts exist and are readable inside the workspace container.\n2. CAAM reports `status=verified` for at least one provider.\n3. Optional (configurable): passive expiry parsing from token metadata.\n4. Optional (configurable): active validation via minimal CLI call (off by default).\n\n#### 16.4.4 Auth Storage Modes \u0026 Keyring Policy\n\nSome CLIs can store credentials in a system keyring. This is **not** suitable for workspace‑isolated automation.\n\n**Policy:**\n- Enforce file‑based storage inside workspace containers.\n- For Codex CLI, set `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `$CODEX_HOME`).\n- If keyring storage is detected, CAAM switches to file mode (provider‑specific).\n- Gateway stores `storageMode` metadata for visibility.\n- API key modes can be valid with optional-only artifacts (e.g., `.claude/settings.json`, `.gemini/.env`).\n\n#### 16.4.5 Account Multiplicity Guidance\n\nMinimum: **1 provider verified**.  \nRecommended for steady throughput: **1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro**.  \nScale‑up guidance: add additional accounts per provider as concurrency grows (rotation handles rate limits automatically).\n\n### 16.5 REST API Endpoints (BYOA‑aware)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/accounts/byoa-status` | workspace BYOA readiness (verified providers, status) |\n| `GET` | `/accounts/profiles` | List CAAM profiles (metadata only) |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/start` | Start OAuth or device‑code flow |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/complete` | Confirm login completion |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/activate` | Activate profile for next agent run |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/cooldown` | Cooldown profile (rate‑limit hit) |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/pools/{id}/rotate` | Force rotation to next profile |\n\n### 16.6 Rotation \u0026 Rate Limit Handling\n\nRotation is driven by CAAM health scores and cooldown timers. When a rate‑limit signature is detected in agent output, the system:\n\n1. Marks the current profile in cooldown.\n2. Selects the next healthiest profile from the pool.\n3. Replays the command (when safe).\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/caam/rotation.ts\n\nasync function handleRateLimit(ctx: RotationContext): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e {\n  await caam.setCooldown(ctx.workspaceId, ctx.profileId, ctx.cooldownMinutes, 'rate_limit');\n  const next = await caam.selectNext(ctx.workspaceId, ctx.provider);\n  await caam.activateProfile(ctx.workspaceId, next.id);\n}\n```\n\n### 16.7 Account Management UI\n\nThe UI prioritizes **BYOA readiness**:\n- Provider cards show number of verified profiles + cooldown status\n- One‑click “Link Account” flows (device code or OAuth URL)\n- Health indicators and recommended profile for each provider\n- Clear warnings when BYOA is insufficient for assignment\n\n### 16.8 BYOA UX Flow (Detailed)\n\n**Onboarding sequence:**\n1.

Flywheel Gateway is the **orchestration backbone** of the Agent Flywheel—a self-improving development cycle where AI coding agents work in parallel, coordinate via messaging, and compound their learnings over time.\n\nThe architecture introduces:\n\n1. **Agent Driver Abstraction** — SDK, ACP, and Tmux backends behind a unified interface\n2. **Command Registry \u0026 Parity Gate** — Single source of truth for REST, WebSocket, tRPC, and OpenAPI (with AI hints)\n3. **REST API Layer** — A performant, well-documented HTTP API across **all flywheel tools**\n4. **WebSocket Layer** — Real-time streaming with durable buffering, ack/replay, and cursor-based resume\n5. **Job Orchestration** — First-class handling for long-running operations with progress events\n6. **Web UI Layer** — A world-class Vite 7.3 / React 19.2 interface with Stripe-level polish, providing unified access to the entire flywheel ecosystem\n7. **Supervisor System** — Lifecycle management for flywheel daemons\n8. **Context Pack Engine** — Token-budgeted prompt assembly from triage, memory, search, and session data\n9. **Checkpoint \u0026 Restore** — Agent state management and disaster recovery\n10. **Conflict Detection** — Real-time file conflict detection and resolution between agents\n11. **Structured Logging \u0026 Audit** — Correlation IDs, redaction, and audit trails for all mutations\n\nThe design prioritizes:\n- **SDK-first execution** — Direct API calls for programmatic control\n- **Protocol flexibility** — Agent Driver abstraction supports multiple backends\n- **Flywheel acceleration** — Every feature designed to make the virtuous cycle spin faster\n- **Full ecosystem integration** — Agent Mail, BV, UBS, CASS, CM, CAAM, SLB unified under one UI\n- **Real-time reliability** — Durable, replayable event streams with ack for critical events\n- **API parity** — Registry-driven OpenAPI with enforced AI hints and examples\n- **Auditability by default** — Structured logs and correlated audit trails across all mutations\n- **Visual excellence** — Desktop and mobile-optimized UX with separate interaction paradigms\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:00.270137321-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:05.309052005-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:05.309052005-05:00","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.3","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:00.271232875-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

Properties\n\nThe design system uses CSS custom properties for runtime theming:\n\n```css\n/* apps/web/src/styles/theme.css */\n\n:root {\n  /* Surface colors (dark theme default) */\n  --surface-0: #0f172a;    /* Deepest background (body) */\n  --surface-1: #1e293b;    /* Cards, panels */\n  --surface-2: #334155;    /* Elevated elements */\n  --surface-3: #475569;    /* Borders, dividers */\n\n

},\n        agent: {\n          claude: 'var(--agent-claude)',\n          codex: 'var(--agent-codex)',\n          gemini: 'var(--agent-gemini)',\n        },\n        status: {\n          idle:

},\n  plugins: [\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\n  ],\n} satisfies Config;\n```\n\n#### Design Principles\n\n1. **Dark-first**: Designed for dark environments (developers, ops)\n2. **High contrast**: WCAG AA minimum for all text\n3. **Semantic colors**: Status and severity encoded in color\n4. **Agent identity**: Consistent visual language per agent type\n5. **Motion with purpose**: Animations indicate state, not decoration\n6. **Information density**: Optimize for at-a-glance comprehension\n\n### 22.2 Core Component Library\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/src/components/ui/Button.tsx\n\nimport { cva, type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority';\n\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  'inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-lg

{children}\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 22.3 Application Shell\n\nDuring Phase 1, the UI should run in a deterministic mock-data mode (fixtures + simulated WS events) so navigation, layouts, and information architecture can ship before all endpoints exist. As registry-backed APIs land, swap mocks to real queries one surface at a time.\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx\n\nexport function AppShell({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');\n\n  return (\n    \u003cdiv className=\"min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100\"\u003e\n      {/* Desktop Sidebar */}\n      {!isMobile \u0026\u0026 \u003cDesktopSidebar /\u003e}\n\n      {/* Main Content */}\n      \u003cmain\n        className={cn(\n          'min-h-screen',\n          !isMobile \u0026\u0026 'ml-64'  // Sidebar width\n        )}\n      \u003e\n        {/* Top Bar */}\n        \u003cTopBar /\u003e\n\n        {/* Page Content */}\n        \u003cdiv className=\"p-6\"\u003e\n          {children}\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003c/main\u003e\n\n      {/* Mobile Navigation */}\n      {isMobile \u0026\u0026 \u003cMobileNavigation /\u003e}\n\n      {/* Global Modals */}\n      \u003cModalProvider /\u003e\n\n      {/* Toast Notifications */}\n      \u003cToaster position=\"bottom-right\" /\u003e\n\n      {/* Command Palette */}\n      \u003cCommandPalette /\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DesktopSidebar() {\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  return (\n    \u003caside className=\"fixed left-0 top-0 h-screen w-64 bg-slate-900 border-r border-slate-800 flex flex-col\"\u003e\n      {/* Logo */}\n      \u003cdiv className=\"h-16 flex items-center px-6 border-b border-slate-800\"\u003e\n        \u003cFlywheelLogo className=\"h-8\" /\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n\n      {/* Navigation */}\n      \u003cnav className=\"flex-1 px-3 py-4 space-y-1\"\u003e\n        {NAV_ITEMS.map(item =\u003e (\n          \u003cNavLink\n            key={item.path}\n            to={item.path}\n            className={({ isActive }) =\u003e\n              cn(\n                'flex items-center gap-3 px-3 py-2 rounded-lg text-sm',\n                isActive\n                  ?

Yet coordination is inherently invisible. When three agents are working on a project, users need to answer questions like:\n- \"Why is BlueLake waiting?\"\n- \"Who has src/api.ts reserved?\"\n- \"Are GreenCastle and RedStone going to conflict?\"\n\nThe Collaboration Graph makes the invisible visible.\n\n#### 22.4.1 Graph Data Model\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/collaboration-graph.ts\n\ninterface CollaborationGraph {\n  nodes: AgentNode[];\n  edges: CollaborationEdge[];\n  reservations: ReservationNode[];\n  conflicts: ConflictNode[];\n  handoffs: HandoffEdge[];\n  lastUpdated: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AgentNode {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'agent';\n  data: {\n    agentId: string;\n    agentName: string;\n    agentType: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\n    status: 'idle' | 'working' | 'thinking' | 'waiting' | 'error';\n    currentTask?: string;\n    contextHealth: ContextHealthStatus;\n    lastActivity: Date;\n  };\n  position: { x: number; y: number };\n}\n\ninterface CollaborationEdge {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'message' | 'handoff' | 'dependency';\n  source: string;  // Agent ID\n  target: string;  // Agent ID\n  data: {\n    messageCount?: number;\n    lastMessageAt?: Date;\n    handoffStatus?: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'completed';\n    animated: boolean;\n  };\n}\n\ninterface ReservationNode {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'reservation';\n  data: {\n    pattern: string;\n    holderId: string;\n    holderName: string;\n    exclusive: boolean;\n    expiresAt: Date;\n    ttlPercent: number;\n  };\n  position: { x: number; y: number };\n}\n\ninterface ConflictNode {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'conflict';\n  data: {\n    conflictId: string;\n    path: string;\n    agents: string[];\n    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';\n    suggestedStrategy?: ConflictStrategy;\n  };\n  position: { x: number; y: number };\n}\n```\n\n#### 22.4.2 Collaboration Graph Component\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/src/components/collaboration/CollaborationGraph.tsx\n\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  Background,\n  Controls,\n  MiniMap,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  ConnectionMode,\n  Panel,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { useWebSocket } from '@/hooks/useWebSocket';\n\nconst nodeTypes = {\n  agent: AgentGraphNode,\n  reservation: ReservationGraphNode,\n  conflict: ConflictGraphNode,\n};\n\nconst edgeTypes = {\n  message: MessageEdge,\n  handoff: HandoffEdge,\n  dependency: DependencyEdge,\n};\n\nexport function CollaborationGraph({ projectKey }: { projectKey: string }) {\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState([]);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState([]);\n  const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState\u003c'agents' | 'files' | 'full'\u003e('agents');\n\n  // Real-time updates via WebSocket\n  const { subscribe } = useWebSocket();\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    const unsubscribes = [\n      subscribe('agents:*', handleAgentUpdate),\n      subscribe('reservations', handleReservationUpdate),\n      subscribe('conflicts', handleConflictUpdate),\n      subscribe('handoffs', handleHandoffUpdate),\n      subscribe('mail', handleMessageUpdate),\n    ];\n\n    return () =\u003e unsubscribes.forEach(u =\u003e u());\n  }, [projectKey]);\n\n  // Fetch initial graph state\n  const { data: graphData } = useQuery({\n    queryKey: ['collaboration-graph', projectKey],\n    queryFn: () =\u003e api.getCollaborationGraph(projectKey),\n    refetchInterval: 30000, // Refresh every 30s as baseline\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() =\u003e {\n    if (!graphData) return;\n\n    const { nodes: layoutNodes, edges: layoutEdges } = computeGraphLayout(\n      graphData,\n      viewMode\n    );\n    setNodes(layoutNodes);\n    setEdges(layoutEdges);\n  }, [graphData, viewMode]);\n\n  // Real-time event handlers\n  const handleAgentUpdate = (event: AgentEvent) =\u003e {\n    setNodes(prev =\u003e prev.map(node =\u003e\n      node.id === event.agentId\n        ?

**Protocol flexibility** — Agent Driver abstraction supports multiple backends\n3. **Flywheel-first** — Every feature accelerates the virtuous cycle\n4. **Streaming-first** — WebSocket for all real-time data; REST for commands/queries\n5. **Unified ecosystem** — All flywheel tools accessible from single UI\n6. **Type-safe end-to-end** — TypeScript from database to UI\n7. **Progressive enhancement** — Web UI enhances but doesn't replace CLI workflows\n\n### 4.3 Key Architectural Invariants\n\n- **No silent data loss** — All operations preserve data integrity\n- **Idempotency** for automation: repeated calls shouldn't spam agents\n- **All operations are auditable**: every API mutation creates a history entry and emits an event\n- **API parity is mandatory**: all capabilities originate in the Command Registry and pass the parity gate\n- **Critical events are durable and replayable**: ack/replay for approvals, conflicts, and other high-stakes topics\n- **Everything is streamable**: if it matters, it emits events and/or is queryable\n\n### 4.4 API Parity Guarantee: The Command Registry\n\nA central design principle ensures that **all operations are defined once and exposed consistently** across REST, WebSocket, and tRPC interfaces. This prevents API drift and guarantees that any capability available through one interface is available through all.\n\n#### The Command Registry Pattern\n\nEvery operation in Flywheel Gateway is registered in a central registry that drives code generation:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/commands/registry.ts\n\ninterface CommandDefinition\u003cTInput, TOutput\u003e {\n  // Identity\n  name: string;                    // e.g., 'agents.spawn'\n  category: CommandCategory;       // 'agents' | 'mail' | 'beads' | 'scanner' | etc.\n  description: string;\n\n  // Schemas (Zod)\n  inputSchema: z.ZodType\u003cTInput\u003e;\n  outputSchema: z.ZodType\u003cTOutput\u003e;\n\n  // REST binding\n  rest: {\n    method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE';\n    path: string;                  // e.g., '/agents'\n    pathParams?: string[];         // e.g., ['id'] for '/agents/{id}'\n  };\n\n  // WebSocket binding (optional)\n  ws?: {\n    emitsEvents: string[];         // Events this command triggers\n    subscribeTopic?: string;       // Topic for streaming results\n  };\n\n  // Behavior metadata\n  idempotent: boolean;\n  safetyLevel: 'safe' | 'requires_confirmation' | 'dangerous';\n  longRunning: boolean;            // Returns job ID instead of result\n\n  // Documentation for AI agents\n  aiHints: {\n    whenToUse: string;\n    commonMistakes: string[];\n    prerequisites: string[];       // Commands to call first\n    followUp: string[];            // Commands typically called after\n  };\n\n  // Handler\n  handler: (ctx: Context, input: TInput) =\u003e Promise\u003cTOutput\u003e;\n}\n\n// Example registration\nexport const spawnAgent = defineCommand({\n  name: 'agents.spawn',\n  category: 'agents',\n  description: 'Spawn a new AI coding agent',\n\n  inputSchema: z.object({\n    model: z.enum(['claude', 'codex', 'gemini']),\n    workingDir: z.string(),\n    driver: z.enum(['sdk', 'acp', 'tmux']).optional(),\n    contextPack: z.string().optional(),\n  }),\n\n  outputSchema: z.object({\n    id: z.string(),\n    model: z.string(),\n    status: z.enum(['starting', 'running']),\n    driver: z.string(),\n  }),\n\n  rest: {\n    method: 'POST',\n    path: '/agents',\n  },\n\n  ws: {\n    emitsEvents: ['agent.spawned', 'agent.state_changed'],\n    subscribeTopic: 'agents:{id}',\n  },\n\n  idempotent: false,\n  safetyLevel: 'safe',\n  longRunning: false,\n\n  aiHints: {\n    whenToUse: 'When you need to start a new coding agent to work on a task',\n    commonMistakes: [\n      'Not specifying workingDir (defaults to cwd)',\n      'Spawning multiple agents on same file without coordination',\n    ],\n    prerequisites: [],\n    followUp: ['agents.send', 'reservations.create'],\n  },\n\n  handler: async (ctx, input) =\u003e {\n    return ctx.agentService.spawn(input);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Code Generation from Registry\n\nThe registry enables automatic generation of:\n\n1. **REST Routes** — Hono routes with Zod validation\n2. **tRPC Procedures** — Type-safe procedures with inference\n3. **OpenAPI Spec** — Complete spec with examples and AI hints\n4. **TypeScript Client** — Fully typed API client\n5. **WebSocket Handlers** — Event subscription setup\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/routes/generated.ts (auto-generated)\n\nimport { commands } from '@flywheel/shared/commands';\nimport { Hono } from 'hono';\n\nexport const generatedRoutes = new Hono();\n\nfor (const cmd of commands) {\n  const { method, path } = cmd.rest;\n\n  generatedRoutes[method.toLowerCase()](path, async (c) =\u003e {\n    const input = await c.req.json();\n    const validated = cmd.inputSchema.parse(input);\n    const result = await cmd.handler(c, validated);\n    return c.json({ data: result, request_id: c.get('requestId') });\n  });\n}\n```\n\n#### Parity Gate: CI Enforcement\n\nThe build fails if parity is violated:\n\n```typescript\n// scripts/parity-check.ts\n\nimport { commands, CommandDefinition } from '@flywheel/shared/commands';\n\nconst violations: string[] = [];\n\nfor (const cmd of commands) {\n  // Every command must have REST binding\n  if (!cmd.rest) {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Missing REST binding`);\n  }\n\n  // Every command must have AI hints\n  if (!cmd.aiHints?.whenToUse) {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Missing AI hints`);\n  }\n\n  // Destructive commands must not be 'safe'\n  if (cmd.rest?.method === 'DELETE' \u0026\u0026 cmd.safetyLevel === 'safe') {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: DELETE should not be marked 'safe'`);\n  }\n\n  // Long-running commands must specify job handling\n  if (cmd.longRunning \u0026\u0026 !cmd.outputSchema.shape.jobId) {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Long-running command must return jobId`);\n  }\n}\n\nif (violations.length \u003e 0) {\n  console.error('❌ Parity violations detected:');\n  violations.forEach(v =\u003e console.error(`  - ${v}`));\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\nconsole.log('✅ All commands pass parity checks');\n```\n\nThis pattern ensures that **new features automatically get full API coverage** — if a developer adds a command to the registry, it's immediately available via REST, WebSocket, and tRPC.\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:25.566532641-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:30.603308195-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:30.603308195-05:00","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-08T19:57:25.567886161-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-zno","title":"RU (Repo Updater) Integration","description":"## Overview\n\nRU (Repo Updater) Integration brings fleet management capabilities to Flywheel Gateway, enabling synchronized operations across multiple repositories. This is essential for organizations managing microservices architectures or monorepo ecosystems where changes must propagate consistently.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\n\nModern software organizations often manage dozens or hundreds of repositories. When making cross-cutting changes (dependency updates, security patches, API migrations), manual coordination becomes impractical. RU provides:\n\n- Centralized visibility into repository health across the fleet\n- Automated synchronization with intelligent conflict handling\n- Agent-sweep orchestration for bulk operations\n- Approval workflows for safe execution\n\nThe integration with Flywheel Gateway allows AI agents to participate in fleet-wide operations under human supervision.\n\n## Repository Status Model\n\nEach repository in the fleet can be in one of six states:\n\n```typescript\ntype RepositoryStatus = \n  | 'current'   // Up-to-date with upstream, clean working tree\n  | 'behind'    // Local is behind upstream, no local changes\n  | 'ahead'     // Local has unpushed commits\n  | 'diverged'  // Both local and upstream have new commits\n  | 'dirty'     // Uncommitted local changes\n  | 'conflict'; // Merge conflicts present\n```\n\n## Agent-Sweep Orchestration\n\nThe three-phase agent-sweep model ensures safe bulk operations:\n\n### Phase 1: Analyze\n- Scan all fleet repositories for status\n- Identify candidates for operation (e.g., repos with outdated dependency)\n- Generate impact assessment report\n- No modifications made\n\n### Phase 2: Plan\n- Generate specific changes for each repository\n- Create preview branches with proposed changes\n- Run CI validation on preview branches\n- Produce human-readable diff summaries\n\n### Phase 3: Execute\n- **REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL**\n- Apply planned changes to target branches\n- Create PRs or direct commits as configured\n- Report success/failure per repository\n- Rollback support for failed operations\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Fleet Service\n\n```typescript\ninterface FleetService {\n  // Fleet Discovery\n  discoverRepositories(config: DiscoveryConfig): Promise\u003cRepository[]\u003e;\n  addRepository(repo: RepositoryConfig): Promise\u003cRepository\u003e;\n  removeRepository(repoId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n  \n  // Status Tracking\n  getFleetStatus(): Promise\u003cFleetStatusReport\u003e;\n  getRepositoryStatus(repoId: string): Promise\u003cRepositoryStatus\u003e;\n  watchFleetStatus(callback: StatusCallback): Unsubscribe;\n  \n  // Sync Operations\n  syncRepository(repoId: string, options: SyncOptions): Promise\u003cSyncResult\u003e;\n  syncFleet(options: FleetSyncOptions): Promise\u003cFleetSyncResult\u003e;\n  \n  // Agent-Sweep\n  startSweep(config: SweepConfig): Promise\u003cSweep\u003e;\n  advanceSweepPhase(sweepId: string): Promise\u003cSweep\u003e;\n  approveSweepExecution(sweepId: string, approver: User): Promise\u003cSweep\u003e;\n  cancelSweep(sweepId: string): Promise\u003cvoid\u003e;\n}\n\ninterface Sweep {\n  id: string;\n  phase: 'analyze' | 'plan' | 'execute' | 'complete' | 'cancelled';\n  repositories: SweepRepository[];\n  createdAt: Date;\n  approvedBy?: User;\n  approvedAt?: Date;\n  results?: SweepResults;\n}\n\ninterface SweepRepository {\n  repository: Repository;\n  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'success' | 'failed' | 'skipped';\n  analysis?: AnalysisResult;\n  plan?: PlanResult;\n  execution?: ExecutionResult;\n}\n```\n\n### Approval Workflow\n\nPhase 3 execution requires explicit human approval:\n\n1. Sweep reaches 'plan' phase completion\n2. System generates approval request with:\n   - Summary of all planned changes\n   - Risk assessment score\n   - Affected repository list\n   - Rollback procedure\n3. Authorized user reviews and approves/rejects\n4. Approval recorded with user identity and timestamp\n5. Execution proceeds or sweep cancelled\n\n## Frontend Components\n\n### FleetDashboard.tsx\n- Grid view of all fleet repositories\n- Status indicators with color coding\n- Quick filters (by status, by tag, by team)\n- Bulk action controls\n\n### SweepWizard.tsx\n- Step-by-step sweep configuration\n- Phase progress visualization\n- Approval interface for Phase 3\n- Results summary view\n\n### RepositoryCard.tsx\n- Individual repository status display\n- Quick sync actions\n- Recent operation history\n- Link to repository details\n\n### FleetStatusChart.tsx\n- Aggregate fleet health visualization\n- Trend graphs for sync status over time\n- Alert indicators for attention-needed repos\n\n## File Locations\n\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/fleet.service.ts` -
