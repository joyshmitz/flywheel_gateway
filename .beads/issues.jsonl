Create `transformZodError(error: ZodError)` utility\n2. Map Zod error codes to user-friendly messages\n3. Flatten path arrays to dot notation (`foo.bar.0.baz`)\n4. Include expected constraints in message\n\n## Example Transformations\n| Zod Error | Transformed Message |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| `{ code: \"too_small\", path: [\"workingDirectory\"] }` | \"workingDirectory is required\" |\n| `{ code: \"invalid_type\", expected: \"number\", path: [\"timeout\"] }` | \"timeout must be a number\" |\n| `{ code: \"too_big\", maximum: 100, path: [\"limit\"] }` | \"limit must be at most 100\" |\n| `{ code: \"invalid_enum_value\", options: [\"A\",\"B\"], path: [\"type\"] }` | \"type must be one of: A, B\" |\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should be done alongside Response Structure work for consistency\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Localization**: English-only initially\n  - Mitigation: Structure allows future i18n\n- **Information Disclosure**: Don't leak internal schema details\n  - Mitigation: Only expose user-facing field names","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:58:02.023408043Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T17:38:33.938922530Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T17:38:33.938922530Z","close_reason":"Completed: transformZodError utility created and integrated into all 14 route files (agents, checkpoints, conflicts, metrics, reservations, context, accounts, ru, alerts, history, utilities, mail, beads, dcg)","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
{"id":"flywheel_gateway-0wr","title":"Mobile Optimization","description":"## Background\n\nMobile users represent a significant and growing portion of web traffic. The Flywheel Gateway dashboard must provide a first-class mobile experience to enable administrators and developers to monitor and manage their AI agent infrastructure from any device. This includes responsive layouts, touch-optimized interactions, and mobile-specific navigation patterns.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nModern dashboards often neglect mobile experiences, forcing users to pinch-zoom and struggle with tiny touch targets. By implementing mobile optimization from the ground up, we ensure:\n\n1. **Accessibility**: Users can manage their agents on-the-go\n2. **Emergency Response**: Critical alerts can be addressed from mobile devices\n3. **Professional Quality**: Demonstrates attention to detail and user experience\n4. **Quality Bar**: Many dashboards have poor mobile support; we aim for a first-class experience\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Responsive Breakpoints\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/styles/breakpoints.ts\nexport const BREAKPOINTS = {\n  xs: 320,   // Small phones\n  sm: 480,   // Large phones\n  md: 768,   // Tablets portrait\n  lg: 1024,  // Tablets landscape / small laptops\n  xl: 1280,  // Desktops\n  xxl: 1536  // Large screens\n} as const;\n\nexport const mediaQueries = {\n  mobile: `(max-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.md - 1}px)`,\n  tablet: `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.md}px) and (max-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.lg - 1}px)`,\n  desktop: `(min-width: ${BREAKPOINTS.lg}px)`\n};\n```\n\n### Touch Target Guidelines\n- Minimum touch target: 44x44px (Apple HIG recommendation)\n- Adequate spacing between interactive elements (8px minimum)\n- Visual feedback on touch (active states, ripple effects)\n\n### Mobile Navigation Architecture\n```typescript\n// Bottom tab bar navigation for mobile\ninterface MobileNavItem {\n  icon: React.ComponentType;\n  label: string;\n  path: string;\n  badge?: number; // For notifications\n}\n\nconst mobileNavItems: MobileNavItem[] = [\n  { icon: HomeIcon, label: 'Dashboard', path: '/' },\n  { icon: AgentsIcon, label: 'Agents', path: '/agents' },\n  { icon: TerminalIcon, label: 'Sessions', path: '/sessions' },\n  { icon: SettingsIcon, label: 'Settings', path: '/settings' }\n];\n```\n\n### Gesture Support Implementation\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/hooks/useMobileGestures.ts\ninterface GestureConfig {\n  onSwipeLeft?: () => void;\n  onSwipeRight?: () => void;\n  onSwipeUp?: () => void;\n  onSwipeDown?: () => void;\n  onPullToRefresh?: () => Promise<void>;\n  swipeThreshold?: number; // Default: 50px\n  pullThreshold?: number;  // Default: 80px\n}\n\nexport function useMobileGestures(config: GestureConfig): {\n  handlers: {\n    onTouchStart: TouchEventHandler;\n    onTouchMove: TouchEventHandler;\n    onTouchEnd: TouchEventHandler;\n  };\n  isRefreshing: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n### Mobile-Optimized Agent Cards\n- Collapsible details to save vertical space\n- Swipe actions (archive, restart, view details)\n- Compact status indicators\n- Touch-friendly action buttons\n\n### Safe Area Handling\n```css\n/* Handle notch and home indicator on modern phones */\n.mobile-container {\n  padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);\n  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);\n  padding-left: env(safe-area-inset-left);\n  padding-right: env(safe-area-inset-right);\n}\n\n.bottom-nav {\n  padding-bottom: max(16px, env(safe-area-inset-bottom));\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Components\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileLayout.tsx` - Main mobile layout wrapper\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/BottomTabBar.tsx` - Bottom navigation\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileAgentCard.tsx` - Touch-optimized agent cards\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/PullToRefresh.tsx` - Pull-to-refresh component\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/SwipeableListItem.tsx` - Swipeable list items\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileHeader.tsx` - Mobile-specific header\n- `apps/web/src/components/mobile/MobileDrawer.tsx` - Slide-out drawer menu\n\n### Hooks\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useMobileGestures.ts` - Gesture detection hook\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useMediaQuery.ts` - Responsive breakpoint detection\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useSwipeActions.ts` - Swipe action management\n- `apps/web/src/hooks/useSafeArea.ts` - Safe area inset detection\n\n### Styles\n- `apps/web/src/styles/breakpoints.ts` - Breakpoint constants\n- `apps/web/src/styles/mobile.css` - Mobile-specific styles\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### Responsive Design\n- [ ] All pages render correctly at 320px width (minimum supported)\n- [ ] Smooth transitions between breakpoints\n- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile devices\n- [ ] Text remains readable without zooming\n\n### Touch Targets\n- [ ] All interactive elements are at least 44x44px\n- [ ] Adequate spacing prevents accidental taps\n- [ ] Visual feedback on all touch interactions\n- [ ] No hover-only interactions\n\n### Navigation\n- [ ] Bottom tab bar visible on mobile viewports\n- [ ] Current route clearly indicated\n- [ ] Badge counts display for notifications\n- [ ] Smooth page transitions\n\n### Gestures\n- [ ] Swipe left/right on agent cards for quick actions\n- [ ] Pull-to-refresh works on list views\n- [ ] Gestures don't interfere with scrolling\n- [ ] Gesture hints for discoverability\n\n### Agent Cards\n- [ ] Compact view shows essential information\n- [ ] Tap to expand for full details\n- [ ] Swipe actions work smoothly\n- [ ] Status changes animate appropriately\n\n### Safe Areas\n- [ ] Content not obscured by notch\n- [ ] Bottom nav above home indicator\n- [ ] Landscape orientation handled correctly\n- [ ] Works on iOS and Android browsers\n\n### Performance\n- [ ] 60fps animations and transitions\n- [ ] Touch response under 100ms\n- [ ] No jank during gestures\n- [ ] Efficient re-renders during interaction\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n- Test on real devices (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)\n- Test with browser dev tools device emulation\n- Verify touch targets with accessibility tools\n- Test gesture interactions with touch simulation\n- Visual regression tests for each breakpoint\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Gesture hooks: swipe/pull-to-refresh state machine and threshold handling\n- [ ] Responsive breakpoints + safe-area handling helpers\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Mobile navigation renders correct routes and preserves state across refresh\n- [ ] Touch target sizing and focus management are validated in component tests\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Mobile viewport (e.g., iPhone 13): navigate core routes without horizontal scroll\n- [ ] Pull-to-refresh on list views triggers refetch and shows loading state\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] E2E tests log viewport/device profile + route transitions; capture traces/screenshots on failure\n- [ ] No sensitive data in browser console logs; correlation IDs are preserved when present\n\n\n## Reference\n\nPLAN.md §23 - Mobile Optimization\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:57:51.712541070Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T20:38:43.891103173Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T20:38:43.891103173Z","close_reason":"Implemented mobile optimization infrastructure: responsive breakpoints (BREAKPOINTS const with xs-xxl), useMediaQuery hook for device detection, useMobileGestures hook with swipe/pull-to-refresh support, useSafeArea hook for device notch handling, MobileAgentCard component with swipe-to-reveal actions, PullToRefresh component with smooth animations.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-1en","title":"Migrate from custom CSS to Tailwind CSS 4.0","description":"## Task\nMigrate the 1927-line custom CSS file (apps/web/src/index.css) to Tailwind CSS 4.0 with design tokens and utility classes.\n\n## Why This Matters\n- Tailwind 4.0 (Jan 2025) offers 5x faster builds with native CSS cascade layers\n- CSS-first configuration reduces complexity\n- Consistent design tokens improve maintainability\n- Per research: \"Modern CSS features: @property support, container queries, wide-gamut colors\"\n- Currently using 1927 lines of custom CSS that duplicates what Tailwind provides\n\n## Files to Modify/Create\n1. apps/web/package.json (add tailwindcss)\n2. apps/web/tailwind.config.ts (NEW)\n3. apps/web/src/index.css (refactor to @tailwind directives + custom tokens)\n4. apps/web/src/components/**/*.tsx (add utility classes)\n5. apps/web/postcss.config.js (if needed for Vite)\n\n## Current State Analysis\n```css\n/* apps/web/src/index.css - 1927 lines including: */\n\n/* Lines 1-98: CSS Variables (colors, spacing, animations) */\n:root {\n  --color-bg: #ffffff;\n  --color-text: #1a1a2e;\n  /* ... 50+ more variables */\n}\n\n/* Lines 100-400: Base/Reset styles */\n/* Lines 400-800: Component styles (.btn, .card, .modal, etc.) */\n/* Lines 800-1200: Layout styles (.container, .grid, etc.) */\n/* Lines 1200-1600: Page-specific styles */\n/* Lines 1600-1927: Dark mode overrides, animations, utilities */\n```\n\n## Target State with Tailwind 4.0\n```css\n/* apps/web/src/index.css - ~200 lines */\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n/* Custom design tokens using Tailwind 4 @theme directive */\n@theme {\n  /* Colors - mapped from existing CSS variables */\n  --color-bg-primary: oklch(98% 0.01 250);\n  --color-bg-secondary: oklch(96% 0.01 250);\n  --color-text-primary: oklch(20% 0.02 260);\n  --color-text-muted: oklch(50% 0.02 260);\n  \n  /* Status colors */\n  --color-success: oklch(72% 0.2 145);\n  --color-warning: oklch(80% 0.18 85);\n  --color-error: oklch(65% 0.25 25);\n  --color-info: oklch(70% 0.15 230);\n  \n  /* Spacing scale (preserve existing) */\n  --spacing-xs: 0.25rem;\n  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;\n  --spacing-md: 1rem;\n  --spacing-lg: 1.5rem;\n  --spacing-xl: 2rem;\n  \n  /* Animation durations */\n  --duration-fast: 150ms;\n  --duration-normal: 300ms;\n  --duration-slow: 500ms;\n  \n  /* Border radius */\n  --radius-sm: 0.25rem;\n  --radius-md: 0.5rem;\n  --radius-lg: 1rem;\n}\n\n/* Dark mode using native CSS */\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  @theme {\n    --color-bg-primary: oklch(15% 0.02 260);\n    --color-bg-secondary: oklch(20% 0.02 260);\n    --color-text-primary: oklch(95% 0.01 250);\n  }\n}\n\n/* Manual theme override */\n[data-theme=\"dusk\"] {\n  @theme {\n    --color-bg-primary: oklch(15% 0.02 260);\n    /* ... dark overrides */\n  }\n}\n\n/* Component base layers (only for things Tailwind can't do) */\n@layer base {\n  body {\n    @apply bg-bg-primary text-text-primary font-sans antialiased;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Custom component classes (minimize these) */\n@layer components {\n  .btn {\n    @apply px-4 py-2 rounded-md font-medium transition-colors duration-fast;\n  }\n  .btn--primary {\n    @apply bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700;\n  }\n  /* Only ~20-30 component classes needed */\n}\n```\n\n## Migration Strategy (Incremental)\n\n### Phase 1: Setup & Tokens (~2 hours)\n1. Install Tailwind 4.0 and configure\n2. Extract all CSS variables into @theme\n3. Keep existing CSS working alongside Tailwind\n\n### Phase 2: Component Migration (~4 hours)\n1. Migrate buttons (.btn-*) to Tailwind utilities\n2. Migrate cards (.card-*) to Tailwind utilities\n3. Migrate forms (.input-*, .select-*) to Tailwind utilities\n4. Migrate modals (.modal-*) to Tailwind utilities\n\n### Phase 3: Layout Migration (~2 hours)\n1. Migrate grid system to Tailwind grid\n2. Migrate container/wrapper classes\n3. Migrate responsive breakpoints\n\n### Phase 4: Cleanup (~2 hours)\n1. Remove unused CSS\n2. Consolidate remaining custom styles\n3. Document token system\n4. Final size optimization\n\n## Component Migration Examples\n\n### Before (Custom CSS)\n```tsx\n// Button.tsx\n<button className=\"btn btn--primary btn--lg\">\n  Click me\n</button>\n\n// index.css\n.btn { padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border-radius: 0.5rem; }\n.btn--primary { background: var(--color-primary); color: white; }\n.btn--lg { padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem; font-size: 1.125rem; }\n```\n\n### After (Tailwind 4.0)\n```tsx\n// Button.tsx - using utilities directly\n<button className=\"px-6 py-3 text-lg bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg \n                   hover:bg-blue-700 transition-colors\">\n  Click me\n</button>\n\n// OR using component class (for complex/repeated patterns)\n<button className=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg\">\n  Click me\n</button>\n\n// With minimal component CSS:\n@layer components {\n  .btn-primary { @apply bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700; }\n  .btn-lg { @apply px-6 py-3 text-lg; }\n}\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests

tokens\n- [ ] Component classes migrated to Tailwind utilities or @layer components\n- [ ] Dark mode working with both auto-detect and manual toggle\n- [ ] Responsive breakpoints working at all viewport sizes\n- [ ] All existing UI visually identical (visual regression tests pass)\n- [ ] CSS bundle size reduced by 50%+ (from ~50kb to <25kb)\n- [ ] No CSS conflicts or specificity issues\n- [ ] All unit tests pass\n- [ ] All visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] All E2E tests pass\n- [ ] Documentation updated with token reference\n\n## Dependencies\n- Should coordinate with: Theme auto-detect (flywheel_gateway-r1x)\n- Ideally before: Component-level work\n\n## Estimated Complexity\nHigh - Large CSS file to migrate, requires visual verification\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n- Keep original CSS file as backup\n- Migrate incrementally (component by component)\n- Visual regression tests catch any visual changes\n- Feature flag to switch between old/new CSS if

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-1hv","title":"FEAT: CM Memory Integration","description":"## Background\n\nCM (Cass-Memory) provides persistent memory and learning capabilities for AI assistants within the Flywheel ecosystem. This integration enables Flywheel Gateway to leverage CM for context-aware assistance, outcome recording, and adaptive behavior based on past interactions.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nWithout persistent memory, AI assistants:\n- Repeat mistakes they've made before\n- Cannot learn user preferences over time\n- Lack context about project conventions\n- Cannot apply learnings from past sessions\n\nCM solves this by maintaining structured memory (rules, preferences, outcomes) that can be queried to enhance AI responses and recorded to improve future interactions.\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Client Architecture\n- Follow flywheel-clients pattern\n- Support both read and write operations\n- Handle privacy settings appropriately\n- Implement local caching with sync\n\n### API Design\n```typescript\ninterface CMClient {\n  // Context Rules\n  getContextRules(context: TaskContext): Promise<ContextRule[]>;\n  getApplicableRules(query: RuleQuery): Promise<ContextRule[]>;\n  \n  // Memory Rules (CRUD)\n  listMemoryRules(filters?: RuleFilters): Promise<MemoryRule[]>;\n  getMemoryRule(id: string): Promise<MemoryRule>;\n  createMemoryRule(rule: MemoryRuleCreate): Promise<MemoryRule>;\n  updateMemoryRule(id: string, updates: MemoryRuleUpdate): Promise<MemoryRule>;\n  deleteMemoryRule(id: string): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Outcome Recording\n  recordOutcome(outcome: OutcomeRecord): Promise<void>;\n  getOutcomeHistory(filters?: OutcomeFilters): Promise<OutcomeRecord[]>;\n  getOutcomeStats(): Promise<OutcomeStats>;\n  \n  // Privacy Management\n  getPrivacySettings(): Promise<PrivacySettings>;\n  updatePrivacySettings(settings: PrivacySettingsUpdate): Promise<PrivacySettings>;\n  exportData(): Promise<DataExport>;\n  deleteAllData(): Promise<void>;\n}\n\ninterface TaskContext {\n  projectId?: string;\n  fileTypes?: string[];\n  currentFile?: string;\n  taskType?: 'coding' | 'debugging' | 'review' | 'documentation' | 'other';\n  technologies?: string[];\n}\n\ninterface ContextRule {\n  id: string;\n  content: string;\n  confidence: number;\n  source: 'explicit' | 'learned' | 'inferred';\n  applicableContexts: string[];\n  lastApplied?: Date;\n}\n\ninterface OutcomeRecord {\n  sessionId: string;\n  taskType: string;\n  success: boolean;\n  rulesApplied: string[];\n  feedback?: string;\n  duration?: number;\n  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Rule Types\n1. **Explicit Rules** - User-defined preferences (\"Always use TypeScript strict mode\")\n2. **Learned Rules** - Derived from outcome patterns (\"In this project, prefer functional components\")\n3. **Inferred Rules** - Extracted from successful sessions (\"User prefers verbose error messages\")\n\n### Privacy Considerations\n- All memory operations must respect privacy settings\n- Support data export for GDPR compliance\n- Clear deletion with confirmation\n- Option to exclude sensitive projects from memory\n- Audit log of memory access (configurable)\n\n### Learning Pipeline\n```\nSession → Outcome Recording → Pattern Detection → Rule Proposal → User Approval → Active Rule\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **CM Client Implementation**\n   -

[ ] getContextRules returns rules matching task context\n   - [ ] Rules include confidence scores\n   - [ ] Rules sorted by relevance and confidence\n   - [ ] Caching with configurable TTL\n\n3. **Memory Rules Management**\n   - [ ] List rules with filtering (type, source, status)\n   - [ ] Create custom rules with validation\n   - [ ] Update rules (content, applicability)\n   - [ ] Soft delete with restore option\n   - [ ] Rule versioning for audit trail\n\n4. **Outcome Recording**\n   - [ ] Record session outcomes with metadata\n   - [ ] Link outcomes to applied rules\n   - [ ] Aggregate statistics available\n   - [ ] Batch recording for performance\n\n5. **Privacy Settings**\n   - [ ] View current privacy configuration\n   - [ ] Toggle memory collection on/off\n   - [ ] Exclude specific projects\n   - [ ] Data export in standard format (JSON)\n   - [ ] Complete data deletion with confirmation\n\n6. **Memory Service Integration**\n   -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-1n6","title":"[Epic] AI Hints in Error Responses","description":"# Epic: AI Hints in Error Responses\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nThe codebase already has an excellent AI hints system defined in `packages/shared/src/errors/ai-hints.ts`, but these hints are NOT included in API error responses. This is a missed opportunity to help both human developers and AI agents recover from errors.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**What exists (ai-hints.ts):**\n```typescript\nAGENT_NOT_FOUND: {\n  severity: \"terminal\",\n  suggestedAction: \"List active agents and use a valid agent ID.\",\n  alternativeApproach: \"Spawn a new agent if the intended one was terminated.\",\n}\n\nRATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: {\n  severity: \"retry\",\n  suggestedAction: \"Wait before retrying the request.\",\n}\n```\n\n**What the API returns:**\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"AGENT_NOT_FOUND\",\n    \"message\": \"Agent not found\",\n    \"correlationId\": \"...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe valuable `suggestedAction` and `alternativeApproach` fields are completely unused!\n\n### Why This Matters\n1. **AI Agent Integration**: Claude, GPT, and other agents can use hints to self-correct\n2. **Developer Experience**: Hints guide developers toward solutions\n3. **Reduced Support Load**: Self-service error resolution\n4. **Already Built**: The work is done, just not exposed\n\n### Proposed Enhancement\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"AGENT_NOT_FOUND\",\n    \"message\": \"Agent not found\",\n    \"severity\": \"terminal\",\n    \"hint\": \"List active agents and use a valid agent ID.\",\n    \"alternative\": \"Spawn a new agent if the intended one was terminated.\",\n    \"correlationId\": \"...\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Goals\n1. **Expose Existing Hints**: Include AI hints in all error responses\n2. **Consistent Severity**: Help clients understand error recoverability\n3. **Actionable Guidance**: Every error tells you what to do next\n4. **AI-Friendly**: Structured for LLM consumption\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Error response type includes hint fields\n- [ ] All error handlers include AI hints\n- [ ] Severity levels exposed (terminal, recoverable, retry)\n- [ ] Tests verify hints are included\n- [ ] Documentation explains hint fields\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Update GatewayError type to include hint fields\n2. Modify serializeGatewayError to include hints\n3. Update handleError functions in all routes\n4. Add hints to WebSocket error messages too\n\n## Severity Levels\nFrom ai-hints.ts:\n- `terminal`: Cannot be recovered automatically, requires user intervention\n- `recoverable`: Can be fixed by modifying the request\n- `retry`: Temporary issue, retry after delay\n\n## Dependencies\n- Response Structure Standardization (for consistent envelope)\n- Validation Error Enhancement (for complete error experience)\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Response Size**: Hints add ~100 bytes per error\n  - Mitigation: Acceptable for error responses (rare path)\n- **Information Disclosure**: Hints might reveal internals\n  - Mitigation: Review hints for security sensitivity","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:58:22.416894911Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T17:51:55.471350385Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T17:51:55.471350385Z","close_reason":"Already implemented: AI hints are fully integrated into response-utils.ts.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-2kf","title":"FEAT: Command Registry + Codegen System","description":"## Overview\n\nThe Command Registry is the **single source of truth** for all API surfaces in flywheel_gateway. Every command definition drives code generation for REST routes, tRPC procedures, OpenAPI specifications, WebSocket event schemas, and TypeScript client SDKs. This pattern ensures API parity across all surfaces and eliminates the possibility of drift between implementations.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\n### Why Command Registry?\n\nTraditional API development often leads to drift between different API surfaces:\n- REST endpoints may accept different parameters than tRPC procedures\n- WebSocket events may have different payload shapes than HTTP responses\n- Client SDKs may fall out of sync with server implementations\n- OpenAPI specs may not reflect actual behavior\n\nThe Command Registry pattern solves this by:\n1. **Single Definition**: Each command is defined once with full type information\n2. **Generated Surfaces**: All API surfaces are generated from command definitions\n3. **Compile-Time Safety**: Type mismatches are caught at build time, not runtime\n4. **Automatic Parity**: Changes to a command automatically propagate to all surfaces\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Command Definition Schema (Zod-based)\n\nEach command is defined using a Zod schema that captures:\n- **name**: Unique command identifier (e.g., `agent.spawn`, `checkpoint.create`)\n- **input**: Zod schema for input validation\n- **output**: Zod schema for output validation\n- **metadata**: Permissions, rate limits, audit requirements\n- **aiHints**: Structured hints for AI-assisted usage\n\n```typescript\nconst spawnAgentCommand = defineCommand({\n  name: 'agent.spawn',\n  input: z.object({\n    repoUrl: z.string().url(),\n    task: z.string(),\n    model: z.enum(['opus-4', 'sonnet-4']).default('sonnet-4'),\n  }),\n  output: z.object({\n    agentId: z.string().uuid(),\n    status: z.enum(['spawning', 'running', 'idle']),\n  }),\n  metadata: {\n    permissions: ['agent:write'],\n    rateLimit: { requests: 10, window: '1m' },\n    audit: true,\n  },\n  aiHints: {\n    whenToUse: 'Use when starting a new agent to work on a task',\n    examples: ['Spawn an agent to fix the login bug', 'Create an agent for the new feature'],\n    relatedCommands: ['agent.stop', 'agent.status'],\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Registration Mechanism\n\nCommands are registered in a central registry that:\n1. Validates command definitions at startup\n2. Detects naming conflicts\n3. Builds lookup indexes for runtime dispatch\n4. Triggers codegen when definitions change\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/commands/registry.ts\nexport const commandRegistry = createCommandRegistry([\n  agentCommands,\n  checkpointCommands,\n  accountCommands,\n  // ... other command groups\n]);\n```\n\n### Codegen Targets\n\nThe codegen system produces the following outputs:\n\n| Target | Output Location | Description |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|\n| REST Routes | `apps/gateway/src/routes/generated/` | Hono route handlers with validation |\n| tRPC Procedures | `apps/gateway/src/trpc/generated/` | Type-safe tRPC router |\n| OpenAPI Spec | `apps/gateway/openapi.json` | Full OpenAPI 3.1 specification |\n| WebSocket Schemas | `apps/gateway/src/ws/generated/` | Event type definitions |\n| TypeScript Client | `packages/client/src/generated/` | Fully typed SDK |\n\n### AI Hints Structure\n\nThe `aiHints` field provides structured guidance for AI-assisted usage:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AIHints {\n  /** When this command should be used */\n  whenToUse: string;\n  /** Example natural language requests that map to this command */\n  examples: string[];\n  /** Related commands the AI should consider */\n  relatedCommands: string[];\n  /** Common mistakes to avoid */\n  pitfalls?: string[];\n  /** Prerequisites that must be met */\n  prerequisites?: string[];\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n```\npackages/shared/src/commands/\n├── registry.ts          # Central command registry\n├── define.ts            # defineCommand helper\n├── types.ts             # Command type definitions\n├── codegen/\n│   ├── rest.ts          # REST route generator\n│   ├── trpc.ts          # tRPC procedure generator\n│   ├── openapi.ts       # OpenAPI spec generator\n│   ├── websocket.ts     # WebSocket schema generator\n│   └── client.ts        # TypeScript client generator\n└── commands/\n    ├── agent.ts         # Agent-related commands\n    ├── checkpoint.ts    # Checkpoint commands\n    ├── account.ts       # Account commands\n    └── index.ts         # Command group exports\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n\n- [ ] Command schema validation tests\n  - Valid command definitions are accepted\n  - Invalid definitions throw descriptive errors\n  - Zod schema compilation works correctly\n- [ ] Each codegen target has dedicated tests\n  - REST generator produces valid Hono routes\n  - tRPC generator produces valid procedures\n  - OpenAPI generator produces valid spec\n  - WebSocket generator produces valid schemas\n  - Client generator produces compilable TypeScript\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n- [ ] Parity tests verify all surfaces accept identical inputs\n- [ ] Parity tests verify all surfaces return identical outputs\n- [ ] Round-trip tests: client -> server -> client type safety\n- [ ] Cross-surface tests: REST and tRPC produce identical results\n\n### Parity Gate Tests\n\nReference: flywheel_gateway-3tp (Parity Gate) implements automated parity verification that runs in CI.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-350","title":"Idempotency Middleware","description":"## Background\n\nIn distributed systems, network failures, client retries, and load balancer timeouts can cause duplicate requests. Without idempotency protection, these duplicates can result in:\n- Duplicate agent invocations (wasted tokens/cost)\n- Inconsistent state (e.g., double-creating resources)\n- Race conditions between concurrent identical requests\n- Poor user experience with unexpected behavior\n\nThe Flywheel Gateway needs robust idempotency middleware to ensure that retrying a request produces the same result as the original, without re-executing the underlying operation.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Idempotency Key Strategy\n\nClients include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique identifier (typically UUID v4). The middleware:\n\n1. **On first request**: Execute handler, cache response with key\n2. **On duplicate request**: Return cached response without re-execution\n3. **On concurrent duplicate**: Block until first completes, return same result\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts\ninterface IdempotencyRecord {\n  key: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  \n  // Request fingerprint\n  method: string;\n  path: string;\n  bodyHash: string;\n  \n  // Response cache\n  statusCode: number;\n  headers: Record<string, string>;\n  body: string;\n  \n  // State\n  status: 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';\n  \n  // Timing\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n  completedAt?: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Request Fingerprinting\n\nTo detect mismatched requests using the same key:\n- Hash the request body (SHA-256)\n- Compare method and path\n- Return 422 if key reused with different request\n\n### Concurrency Handling\n\nWhen a duplicate request arrives while the original is processing:\n\n```typescript\nasync function handleConcurrentRequest(key: string): Promise<Response> {\n  const maxWaitMs = 30000;  // 30 second timeout\n  const pollIntervalMs = 100;\n  \n  for (let elapsed = 0; elapsed < maxWaitMs; elapsed += pollIntervalMs) {\n    const record = await getIdempotencyRecord(key);\n    \n    if (record.status === 'completed') {\n      return reconstructResponse(record);\n    }\n    \n    if (record.status === 'failed') {\n      // Allow retry on failure\n      return null;  \n    }\n    \n    await sleep(pollIntervalMs);\n  }\n  \n  throw new GatewayTimeoutError('Original request still processing');\n}\n```\n\n### TTL Configuration\n\nIdempotency records have configurable time-to-live:\n- Default: 24 hours\n- Minimum: 1 hour  \n- Maximum: 7 days\n- Configurable per-workspace via settings\n\nAfter TTL expiration, the same key can be reused for a new request.\n\n### Storage Backend\n\nOptions for idempotency record storage:\n1. **Redis** (preferred): Fast, built-in TTL, atomic operations\n2. **PostgreSQL**: Fallback if Redis unavailable, requires cleanup job\n3. **Memory**: Development only, not suitable for multi-instance\n\n```typescript\ninterface IdempotencyStore {\n  get(key: string): Promise<IdempotencyRecord | null>;\n  set(key: string, record: IdempotencyRecord): Promise<void>;\n  setIfNotExists(key: string, record: IdempotencyRecord): Promise<boolean>;\n  update(key: string, updates: Partial<IdempotencyRecord>): Promise<void>;\n  delete(key: string): Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n### Scope of Protection\n\nIdempotency middleware applies to mutating endpoints:\n- POST requests (all)\n- PUT requests (all)\n- PATCH requests (all)\n- DELETE requests (configurable)\n\nGET and HEAD requests are naturally idempotent and excluded.\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Core Implementation\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts` - Main middleware\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.store.ts` - Storage abstraction\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.redis.ts` - Redis implementation\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.postgres.ts` - PostgreSQL fallback\n- `apps/gateway/src/types/idempotency.types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces\n\n### Configuration\n- `apps/gateway/src/config/idempotency.config.ts` - TTL and behavior settings\n\n### Tests\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/__tests__/idempotency.test.ts`\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/__tests__/idempotency.integration.test.ts`\n\n## API Behavior\n\n### Headers\n\nRequest:\n```\nPOST /api/agents/invoke\nIdempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\n```\n\nResponse (first request):\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nIdempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\nIdempotency-Replayed: false\n```\n\nResponse (duplicate request):\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nIdempotency-Key: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000\nIdempotency-Replayed: true\n```\n\n### Error Cases\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity\n{\n  \"error\": \"idempotency_mismatch\",\n  \"message\": \"Idempotency key already used with different request parameters\"\n}\n\nHTTP/1.1 409 Conflict  \n{\n  \"error\": \"idempotency_conflict\",\n  \"message\": \"Request with this idempotency key is currently processing\"\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. [ ] Middleware intercepts all POST/PUT/PATCH requests\n2. [ ] Idempotency-Key header is parsed and validated (UUID format)\n3. [ ] First request executes normally and caches response\n4. [ ] Duplicate request returns cached response without re-execution\n5. [ ] Idempotency-Replayed header indicates whether response was cached\n6. [ ] Request fingerprinting detects mismatched key reuse (422 error)\n7. [ ] Concurrent duplicates block until original completes\n8. [ ] TTL is configurable per-workspace (1h to 7d range)\n9. [ ] Expired records are automatically cleaned up\n10. [ ] Redis storage works with automatic TTL expiration\n11. [ ] PostgreSQL fallback works when Redis unavailable\n12. [ ] Failed requests allow retry with same key\n13. [ ] Streaming responses are handled correctly (cache final state)\n14. [ ] Performance overhead is minimal (<5ms for cache check)\n15. [ ] multi-workspace isolation (keys scoped to workspace)\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- **Large response bodies**: Compress before caching, max 10MB\n- **Streaming responses**: Buffer complete response before caching\n- **Request timeout**: Mark as failed, allow retry\n- **Server restart**: Redis persistence preserves records\n- **Clock skew**: Use Redis server time for TTL\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Redis connection (primary storage)\n- PostgreSQL (fallback storage)\n- Request body parsing middleware\n- workspace authentication middleware\n\n## Reference\n\nPLAN.md §8 - Idempotency and Request Deduplication\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Idempotency key parsing + normalization (header + body variants)\n- [ ] Request fingerprinting (method/path/body hash) prevents cross-endpoint replay\n- [ ] Storage adapter: TTL expiry, overwrite rules, and concurrent access behavior\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Repeat the same mutating request with same idempotency key → no duplicate side effects and identical response\n- [ ] Same idempotency key with different request fingerprint → 409/4xx with actionable error code\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Storage unavailable → safe fallback (configurable) with clear error + no partial writes\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + idempotencyKeyHash (never raw key) + replay=true/false\n\n","notes":"## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] IdempotencyKey: parses from header\n- [ ] IdempotencyKey: generates if missing (optional)\n- [ ] IdempotencyKey: validates format\n- [ ] Cache: stores response by key\n- [ ] Cache: retrieves cached response\n- [ ] Cache: expires after TTL\n- [ ] Middleware: checks cache first\n- [ ] Middleware: executes if miss\n- [ ] Middleware: stores after execution\n- [ ] Middleware: returns cached on hit\n- [ ] Conflict: detects in-flight duplicate\n- [ ] Conflict: waits for original to complete\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Duplicate request returns same response\n- [ ] Different key executes independently\n- [ ] In-flight duplicate waits\n- [ ] Expired key re-executes\n- [ ] Error response not cached\n- [ ] Success response cached\n- [ ] All mutating endpoints covered\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Double-click submit safe\n- [ ] Network retry returns same result\n- [ ] Concurrent requests handled\n\n### Performance Tests\n- [ ] Cache lookup <1ms\n- [ ] Cache store <5ms\n- [ ] Minimal latency overhead\n- [ ] High concurrency stable\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Cache unavailable: pass-through\n- [ ] Invalid key format: 400 error\n- [ ] Key collision: detected\n- [ ] Timeout waiting: error returned","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:37:54.340641515Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:47:21.270819761Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:47:21.270819761Z","close_reason":"Implemented idempotency middleware with in-memory caching, request fingerprinting, concurrent request handling, and 23 tests","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-350","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:14Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Client sends HTTP request\n2. Authentication middleware validates token\n3. Route handler receives request\n4. Service layer executes business logic\n5. Database operations performed\n6. Response returned to client\n7. WebSocket events broadcast if applicable\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Bun + Hono?\n- **Performance**: Bun's native HTTP server is 3-4x faster than Node.js\n- **Simplicity**: Hono provides Express-like DX with better types\n- **WebSockets**: Bun has native WebSocket support\n\n### Why SQLite for Development?\n- Zero configuration required\n- File-based, easy to reset\n- Sufficient for single-node deployments\n- PostgreSQL for production scaling\n\n### WebSocket Architecture\n[Diagram: WebSocket message flow]\n\n- Room-based subscription model\n- Server-initiated heartbeats\n- Automatic reconnection with backoff\n- Message acknowledgment for critical events\n```\n\n### AGENTS.md Enhancement\n\n```markdown\n# AGENTS.md\n\n# AI Agent Instructions for Flywheel Gateway\n\n## Project Overview\nFlywheel Gateway is a real-time dashboard for managing AI agents built with:\n- **Runtime**: Bun\n- **Backend**: Hono (TypeScript)\n- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS\n- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL\n- **Testing**: Bun test, Playwright\n\n## Codebase Conventions\n\n### File Organization\n- Feature-based structure in `apps/web/src/`\n- Shared types in `packages/shared/`\n- Tests co-located or in `tests/` directory\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Components: PascalCase (`AgentCard.tsx`)\n- Hooks: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useAgentStatus.ts`)\n- Utils: camelCase (`formatDate.ts`)\n- Types: PascalCase with `T` or descriptive suffix (`AgentStatus`, `ApiResponse`)\n\n### Code Style\n- Prefer `const` over `let`\n- Use explicit return types on exported functions\n- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` with type guards\n- Use template literals for string interpolation\n\n### Component Patterns\n```typescript\n// Preferred: Functional components with explicit props\ninterface AgentCardProps {\n  agent: Agent;\n  onSelect?: (id: string) => void;\n}\n\nexport function AgentCard({ agent, onSelect }: AgentCardProps) {\n  return (/* ... */);\n}\n```\n\n### State Management\n- Local state: `useState`\n- Server state: React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`)\n- Global state: Zustand (minimal use)\n\n### API Patterns\n- Use Hono's typed routes\n- Validate with Zod schemas\n- Return consistent error format\n\n### Testing Requirements\n- Unit tests for utilities and hooks\n- Integration tests for API routes\n- E2E tests for critical paths\n- Aim for 80% coverage on new code\n\n### Logging\n- Tests and doc validation output include doc path + failing section and are secret-safe (no tokens/keys)\n- E2E failures capture screenshots/traces when UI docs/examples are exercised\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Adding a New API Endpoint\n1. Define Zod schema in `packages/shared/src/schemas/`\n2. Add route handler in `apps/gateway/src/routes/`\n3. Update OpenAPI spec in `docs/openapi.yaml`\n4.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-36m","title":"Checkpoint/Restore System with Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing","description":"## Background\n\nThe Checkpoint/Restore System is a critical infrastructure component that enables session state persistence and recovery. This feature addresses the fundamental challenge of maintaining continuity in long-running agent sessions, where context can be lost due to crashes, timeouts, or intentional session transfers.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Session Resilience**: Agent sessions can run for extended periods. Without checkpointing, any interruption means losing all accumulated context and progress.\n\n2. **Cost Efficiency**: Re-running prompts to reconstruct state is expensive both in tokens and time. Checkpoints allow instant restoration.\n\n3. **Multi-Agent Handoffs**: When rotating agents due to context window limits, checkpoints enable seamless state transfer.\n\n4. **Debugging and Replay**: Checkpoints provide snapshots for debugging failed sessions and replaying successful patterns.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Checkpoint Types\n\n```typescript\nenum CheckpointTrigger {\n  MANUAL = 'manual',           // User-initiated via API\n  AUTO = 'auto',               // Scheduled interval-based\n  ERROR = 'error',             // Pre-error state capture\n  ROTATION = 'rotation',       // Before agent rotation\n  MILESTONE = 'milestone'      // After significant progress\n}\n\ninterface Checkpoint {\n  id: string;                  // ULID for ordering\n  sessionId: string;\n  trigger: CheckpointTrigger;\n  type: 'full' | 'delta';\n  sequence: number;            // 1-indexed within session\n  parentId?: string;           // For deltas, reference to base\n  \n  // Storage\n  storagePath: string;\n  sizeBytes: number;\n  compressedSizeBytes: number;\n  \n  // Metadata\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  \n  // State summary\n  messageCount: number;\n  tokenCount: number;\n  beadReferences: string[];    // Beads touched in this session\n}\n```\n\n### Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing\n\nThe system uses a delta-based approach to minimize storage while maintaining fast restore times:\n\n1. **Full Checkpoints**: Every 5th checkpoint (sequence % 5 === 0) stores complete state\n2. **Delta Checkpoints**: Intermediate checkpoints store only changes since the last checkpoint\n3. **Bounded Restore Time**: Maximum 4 deltas to apply ensures O(1) restore complexity\n\n```typescript\n// Delta calculation\ninterface DeltaContent {\n  addedMessages: Message[];\n  modifiedMetadata: Record<string, any>;\n  newBeadRefs: string[];\n  removedBeadRefs: string[];\n  contextWindowDelta: {\n    tokensBefore: number;\n    tokensAfter: number;\n  };\n}\n\n// Restore algorithm\nasync function restore(checkpointId: string): Promise<SessionState> {\n  const checkpoint = await getCheckpoint(checkpointId);\n  \n  if (checkpoint.type === 'full') {\n    return decompress(await readStorage(checkpoint.storagePath));\n  }\n  \n  // Find nearest full checkpoint\n  const chain = await buildRestoreChain(checkpointId);\n  // chain = [fullCheckpoint, delta1, delta2, ..., targetDelta]\n  \n  let state = decompress(await readStorage(chain[0].storagePath));\n  for (let i = 1; i < chain.length; i++) {\n    state = applyDelta(state, chain[i]);\n  }\n  \n  return state;\n}\n```\n\n### Compression Strategy\n\n```typescript\nconst compressionConfig = {\n  algorithm: 'zstd',           // Best ratio for JSON-like data\n  level: 3,                    // Balance between speed and ratio\n  dictionary: true,            // Use trained dictionary for messages\n  \n  // Expected ratios\n  // Full checkpoint: ~4:1 compression\n  // Delta checkpoint: ~10:1 compression (smaller, more repetitive)\n};\n```\n\n### Automatic Compaction\n\nOld delta chains are compacted to reduce storage and simplify restore:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompactionPolicy {\n  // Keep last N full checkpoints\n  retainFullCheckpoints: number;  // Default: 5\n  \n  // Compact deltas older than threshold\n  compactAfterHours: number;      // Default: 24\n  \n  // Delete checkpoints older than threshold\n  deleteAfterDays: number;        // Default: 30\n  \n  // Minimum checkpoints to retain regardless of age\n  minimumRetained: number;        // Default: 3\n}\n\n// Compaction algorithm\nasync function compactSession(sessionId: string): Promise<CompactionResult> {\n  const checkpoints = await getSessionCheckpoints(sessionId);\n  const now = new Date();\n  \n  const result: CompactionResult = {\n    deleted: 0,\n    compacted: 0,\n    freedBytes: 0\n  };\n  \n  // Phase 1: Delete expired checkpoints\n  for (const cp of checkpoints) {\n    if (cp.expiresAt && cp.expiresAt < now) {\n      await deleteCheckpoint(cp.id);\n      result.deleted++;\n      result.freedBytes += cp.sizeBytes;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  // Phase 2: Merge old delta chains into single full checkpoints\n  const oldChains = findCompactableChains(checkpoints, policy.compactAfterHours);\n  for (const chain of oldChains) {\n    const merged = await mergeChainToFull(chain);\n    result.compacted += chain.length - 1;\n    result.freedBytes += chain.reduce((sum, cp) => sum + cp.sizeBytes, 0) - merged.sizeBytes;\n  }\n  \n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Storage Backend\n\n```typescript\ninterface CheckpointStorage {\n  // Write checkpoint data\n  write(sessionId: string, checkpointId: string, data: Buffer): Promise<string>;\n  \n  // Read checkpoint data\n  read(path: string): Promise<Buffer>;\n  \n  // Delete checkpoint\n  delete(path: string): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // List checkpoints for session\n  list(sessionId: string): Promise<CheckpointMetadata[]>;\n}\n\n// Default: Local filesystem with optional S3 tiering\nclass HybridCheckpointStorage implements CheckpointStorage {\n  constructor(\n    private localPath: string,\n    private s3Client?: S3Client,\n    private tierAfterHours: number = 24\n  ) {}\n  \n  // Hot checkpoints on local SSD\n  // Cold checkpoints tiered to S3\n}\n```\n\n## API Design\n\n### REST Endpoints\n\n```typescript\n// Create manual checkpoint\nPOST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints\nRequest: { trigger?: 'manual', metadata?: Record<string, any> }\nResponse: { checkpointId: string, type: 'full' | 'delta', sequence: number }\n\n// List checkpoints\nGET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints\nQuery: { limit?: number, before?: string, after?: string }\nResponse: { checkpoints: Checkpoint[], hasMore: boolean }\n\n// Get checkpoint details\nGET /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints/:checkpointId\nResponse: Checkpoint\n\n// Restore from checkpoint\nPOST /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/restore\nRequest: { checkpointId: string, createNewSession?: boolean }\nResponse: { sessionId: string, restoredFrom: string, messageCount: number }\n\n// Delete checkpoint\nDELETE /api/v1/sessions/:sessionId/checkpoints/:checkpointId\nResponse: { deleted: true }\n```\n\n### WebSocket Events\n\n```typescript\n// Checkpoint created\n{\n  event: 'checkpoint.created',\n  data: {\n    checkpointId: string,\n    sessionId: string,\n    trigger: CheckpointTrigger,\n    type: 'full' | 'delta',\n    sequence: number\n  }\n}\n\n// Checkpoint restored\n{\n  event: 'checkpoint.restored',\n  data: {\n    checkpointId: string,\n    sessionId: string,\n    newSessionId?: string,\n    restorationTimeMs: number\n  }\n}\n\n// Compaction completed\n{\n  event: 'checkpoint.compacted',\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string,\n    deleted: number,\n    compacted: number,\n    freedBytes: number\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n```typescript\ninterface CheckpointConfig {\n  // Auto-checkpoint settings\n  autoCheckpoint: {\n    enabled: boolean;\n    intervalMinutes: number;

The state machine provides a single source of truth for agent status.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n### Why a Formal State Machine?\n- **Correctness**: Only valid transitions are allowed (e.g., can't terminate an already-terminated agent)\n- **Debuggability**: Current and historical states provide clear operational picture\n- **Event-Driven**: State changes trigger appropriate side effects (cleanup, notifications)\n- **Testability**: State machines are easy to unit test exhaustively\n- **Documentation**: The state diagram serves as living documentation\n\n### Why Status Endpoints?\n- **Health Checks**: Load balancers and orchestrators need to check agent health\n- **UI Integration**: Web dashboard displays real-time agent status\n- **Debugging**: Operators can query agent state for troubleshooting\n- **Automation**: External systems can poll for state changes\n\n### Why WebSocket Events?\n- **Real-time Updates**: UI receives instant state change notifications\n- **Reduced Polling**: No need for clients to poll status endpoints\n- **Rich Context**: Events include metadata about state transitions\n- **Scalability**: Pub/sub pattern scales better than polling\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### State Machine Definition\n```typescript\nenum AgentState {\n  SPAWNING = 'spawning',     // Process starting, PTY initializing\n  INITIALIZING = 'initializing', // Agent loading, running init commands\n  READY = 'ready',           // Agent idle, waiting for input\n  EXECUTING = 'executing',   // Agent processing a command/prompt\n  PAUSED = 'paused',         // Agent temporarily suspended\n  TERMINATING = 'terminating', // Graceful shutdown in progress\n  TERMINATED = 'terminated', // Process ended normally\n  FAILED = 'failed',         // Process ended with error\n}\n\n// Valid transitions\nconst transitions = {\n  [AgentState.SPAWNING]: [AgentState.INITIALIZING, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.INITIALIZING]: [AgentState.READY, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.READY]: [AgentState.EXECUTING, AgentState.PAUSED, AgentState.TERMINATING],\n  [AgentState.EXECUTING]: [AgentState.READY, AgentState.PAUSED, AgentState.TERMINATING, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.PAUSED]: [AgentState.READY, AgentState.TERMINATING],\n  [AgentState.TERMINATING]: [AgentState.TERMINATED, AgentState.FAILED],\n  [AgentState.TERMINATED]: [], // Terminal state\n  [AgentState.FAILED]: [],     // Terminal state\n};\n```\n\n### State Metadata\nEach state transition records:\n- Previous state and new state\n- Timestamp of transition\n- Reason for transition (user action, timeout, error, etc.)\n- Any error details for failure states\n\n### Status Endpoint Design\n```\nGET /api/v1/agents/:agentId/status\nResponse:\n{\n  \"agentId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"state\": \"ready\",\n  \"stateEnteredAt\": \"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z\",\n  \"uptime\": 3600,\n  \"lastActivity\": \"2024-01-15T11:25:00Z\",\n  \"healthChecks\": {\n    \"process\": \"healthy\",\n    \"pty\": \"healthy\",\n    \"memory\": \"healthy\"\n  },\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"commandsExecuted\": 42,\n    \"totalOutputBytes\": 102400\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### WebSocket Event Schema\n```typescript\ninterface AgentStateEvent {\n  type: 'agent.state.changed';\n  agentId: string;\n  previousState: AgentState;\n  currentState: AgentState;\n  timestamp: string;\n  reason?: string;\n  error?: {\n    code: string;\n    message: string;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Health Check Strategy\n- **Process Health**: Is the PTY process still running?\n- **Responsiveness**: Did agent respond to last heartbeat?\n- **Memory**: Is agent within memory limits?\n- **Timeout Detection**: Auto-transition to FAILED if unresponsive\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] AgentState enum defines all valid states\n- [ ] State machine validates transitions, throws on invalid\n- [ ] All state transitions are logged with correlation ID\n- [ ] GET /api/v1/agents/:agentId/status returns current state and metadata\n- [ ] WebSocket emits `agent.state.changed` events\n- [ ] Health checks run on configurable interval (default 30s)\n- [ ] Failed health checks trigger state transition to FAILED\n- [ ] State history is queryable for debugging\n- [ ] Unit tests cover all valid transitions\n- [ ] Unit tests verify invalid transitions are rejected\n- [ ] Integration test for spawn -> ready -> executing -> ready flow\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Core Service\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/agent.service.ts` -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-3b1","title":"FEAT: Intelligent Conflict Resolution Assistant","description":"## Overview\n\nAI-powered conflict resolution suggestions that transform detected resource conflicts into actionable resolution strategies with confidence scoring and human-readable rationales.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nConflict detection (Phase 2) identifies when multiple agents attempt to access the same resources, but detection alone is insufficient. Agents need intelligent guidance on **how** to resolve conflicts, not just notification that conflicts exist.\n\nKey challenges that require intelligent resolution:\n- **Priority ambiguity**: Multiple BVs may have similar urgency levels\n- **Progress asymmetry**: One agent may be 90% done while another just started\n- **Resource interdependence**: File A's conflict may cascade to files B, C, D\n- **Historical patterns**: CASS data reveals which resolution strategies worked before\n- **Human context**: Some conflicts require escalation to human decision-makers\n\nWithout intelligent resolution assistance, agents either deadlock waiting for each other, or humans must manually intervene in every conflict—neither scales.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Resolution Strategy Types\n\n| Strategy | Description | When Applied |\n|----------|-------------|--------------|\n| `wait` | Requesting agent waits for holder to complete | Holder near completion (>80% progress) |\n| `split` | Divide resource into non-overlapping segments | File can be logically partitioned |\n| `transfer` | Current holder yields to higher-priority agent | Significant priority differential |\n| `coordinate` | Both agents collaborate on shared resource | Complementary work patterns detected |\n| `escalate` | Route to human decision-maker | High-risk or ambiguous situations |\n\n### Input Sources\n\nThe resolution engine synthesizes data from multiple sources:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                 Conflict Resolution Engine                   │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  Inputs:                                                     │\n│  ├── BV Priorities (urgency, business value, deadlines)     │\n│  ├── Checkpoint Progress (% complete, time invested)         │\n│  ├── CASS History (past resolution outcomes, patterns)       │\n│  ├── Current Reservations (lock duration, scope)             │\n│  └── Agent Capabilities (can agent handle split work?)       │\n│                                                              │\n│  Processing:                                                 │\n│  ├── Strategy Scoring (each strategy scored 0-100)          │\n│  ├── Risk Assessment (what could go wrong?)                  │\n│  └── Evidence Compilation (why this recommendation?)         │\n│                                                              │\n│  Output:                                                     │\n│  └── ResolutionSuggestion (strategy + confidence + rationale)│\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Confidence Scoring (0-100)\n\nConfidence scores indicate how certain the system is about a recommendation:\n\n| Range | Interpretation | Auto-Resolution |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 90-100 | Very high confidence | Auto-apply allowed |\n| 70-89 | High confidence | Auto-apply with notification |\n| 50-69 | Moderate confidence | Requires agent confirmation |\n| 30-49 | Low confidence | Requires human review |\n| 0-29 | Very low confidence | Escalate immediately |\n\n**Evidence categories** contributing to confidence:\n- Priority differential clarity (+/- 20 points)\n- Progress state certainty (+/- 15 points)\n- Historical pattern match (+/- 25 points)\n- Resource criticality assessment (+/- 20 points)\n- Time pressure factors (+/- 20 points)\n\n### Auto-Resolution Rules\n\nLow-risk conflicts can be resolved automatically when:\n1. Confidence score >= 90\n2. Strategy is `wait` with ETA < 5 minutes\n3. No files marked as `critical` or `protected`\n4. Both agents have auto-resolution enabled in preferences\n5. No prior failed resolution attempts for this conflict\n\n### Human-Readable Rationale Generation\n\nEvery suggestion includes a rationale explaining the decision:\n\n```\n\"Recommending WAIT strategy (confidence: 94/100):\n - Agent claude-session-7f2a holds reservation on src/auth/login.ts\n - Current progress: 87% complete (estimated 3 minutes remaining)\n - Your BV priority (P2) is lower than holder's (P1)\n - Historical data: 23/25 similar conflicts resolved successfully with WAIT\n -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-41h","title":"CAAM Account Management (BYOA + Rotation)","description":"## Overview\n\nCAAM (Coding Agent Account Manager) is the **account/profile orchestration layer** for Flywheel Gateway. It is designed for **BYOA (Bring Your Own Account)** subscription logins by default, with optional **BYOK (API key)** support for advanced automation use cases.\n\n**Non-negotiable security invariant:** OAuth credentials are never stored in Gateway's central database. All auth artifacts live inside each workspace's isolated environment, managed by CAAM. Gateway only stores **non-sensitive metadata** (presence, hashes, timestamps, health).\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nAgents consume API tokens fast. Without CAAM, you hit rate limits and stall. With CAAM, you have automatic failover across multiple keys and providers.\n\n### Core Principles\n1. **BYOA first** — subscription accounts (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) are the default path\n2. **No credential custody** — Gateway never sees Google/Anthropic/OpenAI logins or passwords\n3. **workspace-local auth artifacts** — tokens remain inside the workspace container/volume\n4. **Minimum requirement** — at least one verified provider to activate; recommended: 1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro\n5. **Provider parity** — Claude, Codex, and Gemini are all supported\n6. **Autonomous rotation** — cooldown + rotation is automated via CAAM\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Account & Profile Data Model\n\n```typescript\ntype ProviderId = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\ntype AuthMode = 'oauth_browser' | 'device_code' | 'api_key';\n\ninterface AccountProfile {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  name: string;               // Profile label (e.g., \"work\", \"alice@gmail.com\")\n  authMode: AuthMode;\n\n  // Status & health (no secrets)\n  status: 'unlinked' | 'linked' | 'verified' | 'expired' | 'cooldown' | 'error';\n  statusMessage?: string;\n  lastVerifiedAt?: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  cooldownUntil?: Date;\n  lastUsedAt?: Date;\n  healthScore?: number;       // 0..100\n\n  // Auth artifacts (metadata only)\n  artifacts: {\n    authFilesPresent: boolean;\n    authFileHash?: string;    // hash for change detection\n    storageMode?: 'file' | 'keyring' | 'unknown';\n  };\n\n  labels?: string[];\n  createdAt: Date;\n  updatedAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AccountPool {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  profileIds: string[];\n  rotationStrategy: 'smart' | 'round_robin' | 'least_recent' | 'random';\n  cooldownMinutesDefault: number;\n  maxRetries: number;\n}\n```\n\n### CAAM Runner Interface\n\nCAAM runs **inside each workspace container**. Gateway interacts with it via a thin runner interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CaamRunner {\n  listProfiles(workspaceId: string): Promise<AccountProfile[]>;\n  getStatus(workspaceId: string, provider?: ProviderId): Promise<workspaceAuthState>;\n  startLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId, mode?: AuthMode): Promise<LoginChallenge>;\n  completeLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId): Promise<{ status: 'linked' | 'failed' }>;\n  activateProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string): Promise<void>;\n  runWithProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, command: string[]): Promise<ExecResult>;\n  setCooldown(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, minutes: number, reason?: string): Promise<void>;\n}\n\ninterface LoginChallenge {\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  mode: 'device_code' | 'oauth_url' | 'local_browser' | 'manual_copy';\n  code?: string;              // For device code\n  verificationUrl?: string;   // For device code\n  loginUrl?: string;          // For browser OAuth\n  instructions?: string;      // Human-readable fallback\n  expiresInSeconds?: number;\n}\n```\n\n### REST API Endpoints\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/accounts/byoa-status` | workspace BYOA readiness (verified providers, status) |\n| `GET` | `/accounts/profiles` | List CAAM profiles (metadata only) |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/start` | Start OAuth or device-code flow |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/complete` | Confirm login completion |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/activate` | Activate profile for next agent run |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/cooldown` | Cooldown profile (rate-limit hit) |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/pools/{id}/rotate` | Force rotation to next profile |\n\n### Rotation & Rate Limit Handling\n\nWhen a rate-limit signature is detected in agent output:\n1. Mark the current profile in cooldown\n2. Select the next healthiest profile from the pool\n3. Replay the command (when safe)\n\n## File Locations\n\n| Component | Path |\n|-----------|------|\n| CAAM Runner | `apps/gateway/src/caam/runner.ts` |\n| Rotation Logic | `apps/gateway/src/caam/rotation.ts` |\n| Profile Service | `apps/gateway/src/services/account.service.ts` |\n| REST Routes | `apps/gateway/src/routes/accounts.routes.ts` |\n| Account UI | `apps/web/src/components/accounts/AccountManager.tsx` |\n| Login Flow UI | `apps/web/src/components/accounts/LoginWizard.tsx` |\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Account encryption/decryption roundtrips correctly\n- [ ] Pool rotation selects next healthy account deterministically\n- [ ] Rate limit detection parses provider responses\n- [ ] OAuth state generation is cryptographically secure\n- [ ] Cooldown timer enforces minimum wait period\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Account linking flow completes successfully (mock OAuth)\n- [ ] Profile activation updates database correctly\n- [ ] Cooldown status is enforced across requests\n- [ ] Pool membership queries return correct profiles\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] User can link an Anthropic account via device code UI\n- [ ] User can see account health status in dashboard\n- [ ] User can rotate accounts manually via UI\n- [ ] BYOA gating prevents agent spawn without verified account\n\n### Security Tests\n- [ ] API keys are never logged (redaction verified)\n- [ ] API keys are never returned in API responses (only masked)\n- [ ] Encryption key rotation works without data loss\n- [ ] OAuth PKCE flow is implemented correctly\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] All accounts exhausted: queue requests with actionable error\n- [ ] Invalid credentials: mark unhealthy + retry with next profile\n- [ ] Decryption fails: alert and disable profile\n- [ ] Rotation loop: circuit breaker prevents infinite loops\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Tests log anonymized account/profile identifiers + provider + correlationId; secrets are never logged\n- [ ] E2E failure artifacts include UI screenshots + network traces with sensitive headers redacted\n\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Account records can be created/updated/disabled with encrypted-at-rest secrets and safe redaction in logs\n- [ ] Rotation strategy selects a healthy account deterministically (round-robin / least-recent / policy-based) and respects cooldowns\n- [ ] Provider failures are classified into actionable error codes (retryable vs terminal) with recovery hints\n- [ ] BYOA gating is enforced for execution paths that require provider credentials\n- [ ] Audit log captures all mutations (create/update/disable/rotate) with correlation IDs\n- [ ] UI flow makes it hard to misconfigure accounts and provides clear health/status indicators\n- [ ] Device code and OAuth flows work across all three providers (Claude, Codex, Gemini)\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md §16 - CAAM Account & Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)\n- `/data/projects/coding_agent_account_manager` - CAAM CLI implementation","notes":"Fixed all TypeScript errors in CAAM implementation (imports, audit calls, exactOptionalPropertyTypes issues, implicit any types).

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-45c","title":"Context Pack Builder with Token Budgeting","description":"## Background\n\nThe Context Pack Builder is the core orchestration component that assembles optimized context for agent prompts. It pulls from multiple data sources (Bead Valuation, Collective Memory, CASS) and intelligently allocates token budget to maximize prompt effectiveness while respecting model limits.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Agent Effectiveness**: Agents perform better with relevant, well-structured context. Random or poorly-prioritized context leads to confusion and errors.\n\n2. **Token Efficiency**: Model context windows are expensive. Every token must earn its place through relevance and utility.\n\n3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Different tasks require different context mixes. A debugging task needs error history; a planning task needs project structure.\n\n4. **Budget Compliance**: Exceeding context limits causes truncation or errors. Strict budget management ensures predictable behavior.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Context Pack Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface ContextPack {\n  id: string;                    // ULID for tracking\n  sessionId: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  \n  // Budget tracking\n  budget: {\n    total: number;               // Total tokens available\n    used: number;                // Tokens used\n    remaining: number;           // Tokens remaining\n    breakdown: TokenBreakdown;   // Per-section allocation\n  };\n  \n  // Context sections\n  sections: {\n    triage: TriageSection;       // From Bead Valuation\n    memory: MemorySection;       // From Collective Memory\n    search: SearchSection;       // From CASS\n    history: HistorySection;     // Recent conversation\n    system: SystemSection;       // System prompts\n  };\n  \n  // Metadata\n  metadata: {\n    buildTimeMs: number;\n    sourcesQueried: string[];\n    truncations: TruncationRecord[];\n  };\n}\n\ninterface TokenBreakdown {\n  system: number;                // System prompt allocation\n  triage: number;                // Triage beads allocation\n  memory: number;                // Memory rules allocation\n  search: number;                // Search results allocation\n  history: number;               // Conversation history allocation\n  reserved: number;              // Reserved for response\n}\n```\n\n### Token Budget Allocation Strategy\n\n```typescript\ninterface BudgetStrategy {\n  // Fixed allocations (absolute tokens)\n  fixed: {\n    system: number;              // System prompt, typically 500-1000\n    reserved: number;            // Response buffer, typically 2000-4000\n  };\n  \n  // Proportional allocations (% of remaining)\n  proportional: {\n    triage: number;              // Default: 0.30 (30%)\n    memory: number;              // Default: 0.20 (20%)\n    search: number;              // Default: 0.25 (25%)\n    history: number;             // Default: 0.25 (25%)\n  };\n  \n  // Minimum allocations (floor)\n  minimums: {\n    triage: number;              // At least 500 tokens\n    memory: number;              // At least 300 tokens\n    search: number;              // At least 500 tokens\n    history: number;             // At least 1000 tokens\n  };\n  \n  // Priority order for overflow redistribution\n  priority: ('triage' | 'memory' | 'search' | 'history')[];\n}\n\n// Default strategy\nconst defaultStrategy: BudgetStrategy = {\n  fixed: { system: 800, reserved: 3000 },\n  proportional: { triage: 0.30, memory: 0.20, search: 0.25, history: 0.25 },\n  minimums: { triage: 500, memory: 300, search: 500, history: 1000 },\n  priority: ['triage', 'history', 'search', 'memory']\n};\n\nfunction allocateBudget(\n  totalTokens: number,\n  strategy: BudgetStrategy\n): TokenBreakdown {\n  const available = totalTokens -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-46c","title":"FEAT: WebSocket Infrastructure with Durable Ring Buffers","description":"## Background\n\nReal-time communication is essential for the Flywheel Gateway. Clients need instant updates when:\n- Agent output streams in (stdout, stderr, tool results)\n- Agent state changes (ready, executing, terminated)\n- Conflicts arise requiring human resolution\n- Mail arrives from other agents\n- Reservations are acquired or released\n\nWebSocket connections are inherently unreliable - networks drop, clients reconnect. The ring buffer system ensures no messages are lost during brief disconnections by allowing cursor-based replay.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why Ring Buffers?\n- **Bounded Memory**: Fixed-size buffers prevent memory exhaustion from slow consumers\n- **Fast Replay**: Clients reconnecting after brief disconnects get caught up instantly\n- **Cursor-Based**: Opaque cursors allow stateless servers (cursor encodes position)\n- **TTL Expiry**: Old messages automatically expire, keeping buffers fresh\n\n### Why Per-Channel Buffers?\n- **Isolation**: High-volume channels (output) don't starve low-volume ones (conflicts)\n- **Tuning**: Different channels can have different buffer sizes and TTLs\n- **Permissions**: Subscription authorization is per-channel\n\n### Hub Architecture\nThe WebSocket hub acts as a message broker:\n1. Publishers (drivers, API handlers) push messages to topics\n2. Hub fans out to all subscribed connections\n3. Each channel maintains its own ring buffer\n4. Connections track their cursor per channel\n\n## Scope & Requirements\n\n### WebSocket Hub\n\n```typescript\ninterface WebSocketHub {\n  // Connection management\n  addConnection(ws: WebSocket, auth: AuthContext): ConnectionHandle;\n  removeConnection(connectionId: string): void;\n  \n  // Subscriptions\n  subscribe(connectionId: string, channel: Channel, cursor?: string): void;\n  unsubscribe(connectionId: string, channel: Channel): void;\n  \n  // Publishing\n  publish(channel: Channel, message: HubMessage): void;\n  \n  // Replay\n  replay(channel: Channel, cursor: string, limit?: number): HubMessage[];\n  \n  // Monitoring\n  getStats(): HubStats;\n}\n\ninterface ConnectionHandle {\n  connectionId: string;\n  connectedAt: Date;\n  subscriptions: Set<Channel>;\n  lastHeartbeat: Date;\n  cursor: Map<Channel, string>;\n}\n\ninterface HubStats {\n  activeConnections: number;\n  subscriptionsByChannel: Map<Channel, number>;\n  messagesPerSecond: number;\n  bufferUtilization: Map<Channel, number>;\n}\n```\n\n### Channel Types\n\n```typescript\ntype Channel = \n  // Agent-scoped channels\n  | { type: 'agent:output'; agentId: string }\n  | { type: 'agent:state'; agentId: string }\n  | { type: 'agent:tools'; agentId: string }\n  \n  // workspace-scoped channels\n  | { type: 'workspace:agents'; workspaceId: string }\n  | { type: 'workspace:reservations'; workspaceId: string }\n  | { type: 'workspace:conflicts'; workspaceId: string }\n  \n  // User-scoped channels\n  | { type: 'user:mail'; userId: string }\n  | { type: 'user:notifications'; userId: string }\n  \n  // System channels\n  | { type: 'system:health' }\n  | { type: 'system:metrics' };\n\n// Channel string format: \"type:id\" e.g., \"agent:output:agent-abc123\"\nfunction channelToString(channel: Channel): string;\nfunction parseChannel(str: string): Channel;\n```\n\n### Ring Buffer Implementation\n\n```typescript\ninterface RingBuffer<T> {\n  capacity: number;\n  ttlMs: number;\n  \n  push(item: T): string;              // Returns cursor\n  get(cursor: string): T | undefined;\n  slice(cursor: string, limit?: number): T[];\n  getLatestCursor(): string;\n  \n  // Maintenance\n  prune(): number;                    // Remove expired, return count\n  clear(): void;\n  \n  // Stats\n  size(): number;\n  oldestCursor(): string | undefined;\n}\n\n// Cursor format: base64(timestamp:sequence)\n// Allows cursor comparison without buffer access\ninterface CursorData {\n  timestamp: number;\n  sequence: number;\n}\n\nfunction encodeCursor(data: CursorData): string;\nfunction decodeCursor(cursor: string): CursorData;\nfunction compareCursors(a: string, b: string): -1 | 0 | 1;\n```\n\n### Buffer Configuration Per Channel Type\n\n```typescript\nconst BUFFER_CONFIG: Record<string, BufferConfig> = {\n  'agent:output': {\n    capacity: 10000,    // High volume, many messages\n    ttlMs: 300000,      // 5 minutes - reconnect window\n  },\n  'agent:state': {\n    capacity: 100,      // Low volume\n    ttlMs: 3600000,     // 1 hour - state history\n  },\n  'workspace:conflicts': {\n    capacity: 500,\n    ttlMs: 1800000,     // 30 minutes\n  },\n  'user:mail': {\n    capacity: 1000,\n    ttlMs: 86400000,    // 24 hours - important messages\n  },\n  'system:health': {\n    capacity: 60,       // 1 per second\n    ttlMs: 60000,       // 1 minute\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Message Format\n\n```typescript\ninterface HubMessage {\n  id: string;                    // UUID for deduplication\n  cursor: string;                // Ring buffer cursor\n  timestamp: Date;\n  channel: string;               // Serialized channel\n  \n  type: MessageType;\n  payload: unknown;              // Type-specific payload\n  \n  metadata?: {\n    correlationId?: string;\n    agentId?: string;\n    userId?: string;\n    workspaceId?: string;\n  };\n}\n\ntype MessageType =\n  | 'output.chunk'\n  | 'state.change'\n  | 'tool.start'\n  | 'tool.end'\n  | 'reservation.acquired'\n  | 'reservation.released'\n  | 'conflict.detected'\n  | 'conflict.resolved'\n  | 'mail.received'\n  | 'health.ping'\n  | 'error';\n```\n\n### Heartbeat Protocol\n\n```typescript\n// Client sends ping every 30 seconds\ninterface PingMessage {\n  type: 'ping';\n  timestamp: number;\n}\n\n// Server responds with pong + connection stats\ninterface PongMessage {\n  type: 'pong';\n  timestamp: number;\n  serverTime: number;\n  subscriptions: string[];\n  cursors: Record<string, string>;\n}\n\n// Server sends heartbeat every 30 seconds to all connections\ninterface HeartbeatMessage {\n  type: 'heartbeat';\n  serverTime: number;\n}\n\n// Connection considered dead after 90 seconds without ping\nconst HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 30000;\nconst CONNECTION_TIMEOUT = 90000;\n```\n\n### Reconnection Flow\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Client connects with last known cursors\ninterface ReconnectRequest {\n  type: 'reconnect';\n  cursors: Record<string, string>;  // channel -> cursor\n}\n\n// 2. Server validates cursors, replays missed messages\ninterface ReconnectResponse {\n  type: 'reconnect_ack';\n  replayed: Record<string, number>; // channel -> message count\n  expired: string[];                // channels where cursor expired\n  newCursors: Record<string, string>;\n}\n\n// 3. If cursor expired, client can either:\n//    a. Accept current cursor (lose messages)\n//    b.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-483","title":"[Epic] Request ID Enhancement","description":"# Epic: Request ID Enhancement\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nThe API includes `correlationId` in responses, but there's no distinct `requestId` that directly maps to what's logged server-side. This makes debugging and support requests harder.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {...},\n  \"correlationId\": \"abc-123-def\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `correlationId` is useful for tracing but:\n- May be shared across multiple requests in a flow\n- Not always the same as what's logged\n- Not returned in response headers\n\n### Industry Standard (Stripe)\nStripe includes request ID in both body and headers:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nRequest-Id: req_abc123\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"id\": \"ch_xxx\",\n  \"object\": \"charge\",\n  \"request_id\": \"req_abc123\"\n}\n```\n\nBenefits:\n- Support: \"I got error on request req_abc123\"\n- Logs: Directly searchable\n- Headers: Available even on parse failures\n\n### Difference: Request ID vs Correlation ID\n- **Request ID**: Unique per HTTP request, generated by server\n- **Correlation ID**: Shared across related requests in a flow, may be client-provided\n\nBoth are valuable but serve different purposes.\n\n## Goals\n1. **Traceability**: Every request has unique, logged ID\n2. **Accessibility**: ID in both headers and body\n3. **Support**: Easy to reference in bug reports\n4. **Searchable**: Direct log lookup by ID\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Request ID generation utility created\n- [ ] All responses include Request-Id header\n- [ ] All responses include requestId in body\n- [ ] Logs include the same request ID\n- [ ] Error responses always include ID\n- [ ] Tests verify ID presence\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Create request ID generation (ulid or nanoid)\n2. Add middleware to generate and attach to context\n3. Include in response headers\n4. Include in response body via envelope\n5. Ensure logging includes same ID\n\n## ID Format Options\n- **UUID v4**: Standard, long (36 chars)\n- **ULID**: Sortable, shorter (26 chars)\n- **Nanoid**: Configurable length, URL-safe\n- **Prefixed**: `req_abc123` like Stripe\n\nRecommendation: ULID with `req_` prefix for readability.\n\n## Implementation Details\n```typescript\n// Middleware\napp.use('*', async (c, next) => {\n  const requestId = `req_${ulid()}`;\n  c.set('requestId', requestId);\n  await next();\n  c.header('Request-Id', requestId);\n});\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- Response Structure Standardization (to include in envelope)\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **ID Collision**: ULIDs are practically unique\n  - Mitigation: 128-bit entropy is sufficient\n- **Performance**: ID generation is cheap\n  - Mitigation: ulid/nanoid are fast (1M+ ops/sec)","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T15:02:02.605694703Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-13T00:31:25.877982399Z","closed_at":"2026-01-13T00:31:25.877982399Z","close_reason":"Already implemented: apps/gateway/src/middleware/correlation.ts generates both correlationId and requestId, sets X-Correlation-ID and X-Request-ID response headers, stores in AsyncLocalStorage for propagation.

This is one of the highest-friction and highest-risk parts of the system:\n\n- Users get stuck on ambiguous auth failures (expired device codes, revoked tokens, missing scopes).\n- Users may accidentally persist or paste secrets into unsafe places (logs, screenshots, copied terminal output).\n- Without explicit guidance, “it works on my machine” scenarios become support burdens.\n\nThis bead focuses on improving the **UX + copy + guardrails** around CAAM onboarding so users can successfully connect accounts quickly, safely, and with clear recovery steps.\n\n## Goals\n\n- Make device-code flows guided and self-explanatory (no need to read docs for the happy path).\n- Make persistence and redaction rules explicit (what gets stored, where, and how it is protected).\n- Surface common failure modes with actionable fixes, not generic errors.\n- Keep everything compatible with the broader CAAM implementation bead (`flywheel_gateway-41h`).\n\n## Scope\n\n### 1) Guided device-code flow UX\n\n- Step-by-step UI with:\n  - copy-to-clipboard for codes\n  - verification URL link handling\n  - countdown timers / expiry visibility\n  - polling status with backoff\n  - explicit cancel/retry\n  - clear mapping of provider failures → recovery actions\n\n### 2) Secure manual auth import/upload copy\n\n- Explicit copy for users who need to import auth material:\n  - what formats are accepted\n  - what fields are required\n  - where data is stored (and that it is encrypted-at-rest)\n  - what is never stored\n  - how logs and artifacts are redacted\n\n### 3) BYOA onboarding guidance + warnings\n\n- Clear onboarding copy that includes:\n  - prerequisites (accounts, scopes)\n  - expected rate-limit behaviors\n  - common failures and recovery\n  - safe defaults and confirmations for risky actions\n\n### 4) \"Make risky actions deliberate\" UX patterns\n\n- Confirmations + safe defaults\n- Prevent accidental persistence\n- Ensure sensitive fields are masked and never re-rendered once submitted\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Implementing CAAM backend primitives (handled by `flywheel_gateway-41h`).\n- Adding provider-specific auth modes beyond the device-code + manual-import UX specified here.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] UX provides a guided device-code flow (clear steps, copy-to-clipboard, polling status, error recovery)\n- [ ] Manual import/upload guidance is explicit about what is stored, where it is stored, and how it is redacted in logs\n- [ ] Onboarding copy explains prerequisites and common failure modes (revoked tokens, expired device codes, insufficient scopes)\n- [ ] UI makes risky actions deliberate (confirmations, safe defaults, no accidental persistence)\n- [ ] Doc changes stay aligned with the implemented UI and do not reference any private business details\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Copy helpers and form validation (required fields, scope warnings, expired code states)\n- [ ] State machine for device-code flow (idle → pending → authorized/failed)\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Happy path onboarding (mock provider): start device-code → confirm authorized → account becomes healthy\n- [ ] Failure modes: expired code, revoked token, missing scope → UI shows actionable recovery steps\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Device-code onboarding API mocks and state transitions (pending → authorized/failed)\n- [ ] Token import/upload path persists securely and redacts logs\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Test logs include correlationId + anonymized accountId; secrets are never logged\n\n## References\n\n- `flywheel_gateway-41h`: CAAM Account Management (BYOA + Rotation)\n- `flywheel_gateway-y19.21`: PLAN: 16.

Start → 2. Authorize → 3. Complete)\n   - Provider selection if not pre-selected\n   - Code display with copy button\n   - QR code for mobile (optional)\n   - Countdown timer\n   - Status indicator (polling animation)\n   - Cancel button\n   - Retry button (on expiry/error)\n\n2. **DeviceCodeDisplay.tsx** - Code presentation\n   - Large, monospace code display\n   - Copy-to-clipboard with feedback\n   - Verification URL as clickable link\n   - \"Open in browser\" button\n   - Expiry countdown\n\n3. **AuthorizationStatus.tsx** - Polling feedback\n   - Animated polling indicator\n   - \"Waiting for authorization...\" text\n   - Attempt count (silent, for debugging)\n   - Timeout warning at 80% of expiry\n\n### API Endpoints\n\n```typescript\n// POST /accounts/providers/:provider/device-code/start\n// Returns: { deviceCode, userCode, verificationUrl, expiresIn, pollInterval }\n\n// GET /accounts/providers/:provider/device-code/:deviceCode/status  \n// Returns: { status: 'pending' | 'authorized' | 'expired' | 'denied', profile?: AccountProfile }\n```\n\n### Error Recovery Mapping\n\n| Error | User Message | Recovery Action |\n|-------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Device code expired | \"Authorization timed out\" | \"Start over\" button |\n| User denied | \"Authorization was denied\" | \"Try again\" or \"Use different account\" |\n| Invalid scope | \"Missing required permissions\" | Show required scopes, retry link |\n| Network error | \"Connection lost\" | Auto-retry with backoff, manual retry |\n| Provider unavailable | \"[Provider] is temporarily unavailable\" | Retry after delay, status page link |\n\n### Detailed E2E Test Specs\n\n```typescript\n// tests/e2e/caam/device-code-flow.spec.ts\n\ntest.describe('Device Code Flow', () => {\n  test.describe('Happy Path', () => {\n    test('should complete authorization successfully', async ({ page }) => {\n      // 1.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-59c","title":"Comprehensive Notification System","description":"## Background\n\nEffective observability requires proactive alerting when important events occur in the system. Users should not need to constantly monitor dashboards to stay informed about agent status changes, cost anomalies, conflict resolutions, or system issues. A comprehensive notification system bridges this gap by delivering relevant information through the user's preferred channels.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, users must manually check the platform to discover issues or important events. This leads to delayed responses to critical situations (agent failures, cost overruns, conflicts requiring approval) and reduces overall platform effectiveness. Different users have different notification preferences - some prefer email digests while others need real-time Slack alerts for urgent issues.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Notification Event Types\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/types/notification.types.ts\n\ntype NotificationCategory = \n  | 'agent'      // Agent lifecycle events\n  | 'conflict'   // Conflict detection and resolution\n  | 'bead'       // Bead status changes\n  | 'cost'       // Cost alerts and anomalies\n  | 'system'     // System health and maintenance\n  | 'security'   // Security-related events\n  | 'team';      // Team and collaboration events\n\ninterface NotificationEvent {\n  id: string;\n  category: NotificationCategory;\n  type: NotificationEventType;\n  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical';\n  title: string;\n  message: string;\n  data: Record<string, any>; // Event-specific payload\n  actorId?: string; // User/agent that triggered event\n  targetId?: string; // Affected entity ID\n  targetType?: string; // Entity type (agent, bead, etc.)\n  orgId: string;\n  timestamp: Date;\n}\n\n// Agent events\ntype AgentEventType = \n  | 'agent.created'\n  | 'agent.started'\n  | 'agent.stopped'\n  | 'agent.error'\n  | 'agent.recovered'\n  | 'agent.rate_limited'\n  | 'agent.quota_exceeded'\n  | 'agent.config_changed';\n\n// Conflict events\ntype ConflictEventType =\n  | 'conflict.detected'\n  | 'conflict.auto_resolved'\n  | 'conflict.needs_review'\n  | 'conflict.escalated'\n  | 'conflict.resolved'\n  | 'conflict.timeout';\n\n// Cost events\ntype CostEventType =\n  | 'cost.budget_warning'     // 80% threshold\n  | 'cost.budget_critical'    // 95% threshold\n  | 'cost.budget_exceeded'\n  | 'cost.anomaly_detected'\n  | 'cost.daily_summary'\n  | 'cost.weekly_report';\n\n// System events\ntype SystemEventType =\n  | 'system.maintenance_scheduled'\n  | 'system.maintenance_started'\n  | 'system.maintenance_completed'\n  | 'system.degraded_performance'\n  | 'system.incident_started'\n  | 'system.incident_resolved'\n  | 'system.update_available';\n```\n\n### Multi-Channel Delivery Architecture\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/services/notification.service.ts\n\ninterface NotificationService {\n  // Core dispatch\n  dispatch(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<void>;\n  dispatchBatch(events: NotificationEvent[]): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Channel-specific\n  sendInApp(userId: string, notification: Notification): Promise<void>;\n  sendEmail(userId: string, notification: Notification): Promise<void>;\n  sendSlack(channelConfig: SlackConfig, notification: Notification): Promise<void>;\n  sendWebhook(webhookConfig: WebhookConfig, notification: Notification): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Digest management\n  queueForDigest(userId: string, notification: Notification): Promise<void>;\n  processDigests(frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly'): Promise<void>;\n}\n\n// Channel implementations\ninterface NotificationChannel {\n  type: 'in_app' | 'email' | 'slack' | 'webhook';\n  enabled: boolean;\n  config: ChannelConfig;\n  send(notification: FormattedNotification): Promise<DeliveryResult>;\n}\n\ninterface SlackChannelConfig {\n  webhookUrl: string;\n  channel?: string;

All notification event types trigger appropriate notifications\n2. In-app notifications appear in real-time via WebSocket\n3. Email notifications are delivered within 30 seconds (non-digest)\n4. Slack integration works with workspace OAuth flow\n5. Webhook delivery includes retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff)\n6. User preferences are respected for all notification routing\n7. Quiet hours prevent non-urgent notifications during specified times\n8. Daily/weekly digests are delivered at user-configured times\n9. Notification center shows unread badge with accurate count\n10. Mark as read/unread works individually and in bulk\n11. Notification search and filtering works across all fields\n12. Test notification feature works for all channels\n13. Performance: Dispatch 1000 notifications/second without blocking\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests for notification service and each channel\n- Integration tests for end-to-end delivery\n- Mock external services (SendGrid, Slack) in tests\n- Load testing for high-volume scenarios\n- E2E tests for notification preferences UI\n\n## Reference\n\nPLAN.md section 21.9 - Comprehensive Notification System\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Notification routing respects per-category preferences and quiet hours\n- [ ] Deduping and digest logic prevents notification storms\n- [ ] Retry/backoff policy for delivery channels behaves deterministically\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Trigger a representative event → notification is created, stored, and emitted via WebSocket\n- [ ] Preference updates take effect immediately for subsequent notifications\n\n### E2E Tests (UI)\n- [ ] User can configure preferences and verify a test notification appears\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + notificationId + category + channel + deliveryStatus\n\n\n","notes":"## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Notification: creates with required fields\n- [ ] Notification: serializes correctly\n- [ ] Channel: email formatter works\n- [ ] Channel: Slack formatter works\n- [ ] Channel: webhook formatter works\n- [ ] Preferences: parses user settings\n- [ ] Preferences: applies to notification\n- [ ] Digest: batches notifications\n- [ ] Digest: formats summary\n- [ ] DoNotDisturb: checks schedule\n- [ ] DoNotDisturb: defers notification\n- [ ] Priority: routes urgent immediately\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] POST /notifications creates notification\n- [ ] Email delivery works\n- [ ] Slack delivery works\n- [ ] Webhook delivery works\n- [ ] Preferences applied to routing\n- [ ] Digest sent at scheduled time\n- [ ] DND respects schedule\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] User receives email notification\n- [ ] User receives Slack notification\n- [ ] Preferences UI saves correctly\n- [ ] Digest contains batched items\n\n### Performance Tests\n- [ ] Notification send <100ms\n- [ ] Batch 1000 notifications <5s\n- [ ] Digest generation <1s\n- [ ] Preference lookup <10ms\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Email service down: retry queue\n- [ ] Slack service down: fallback channel\n- [ ] Invalid preferences: default used\n- [ ] Rate limit: backoff applied","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:59:33.393366195Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T22:15:38.454855167Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T22:15:38.454860117Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-59c","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-f9d","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:15Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Without coordination, agents might simultaneously modify the same file, leading to merge conflicts, lost work, or inconsistent state.\n\nThis system provides glob-based file reservations with two modes:\n- **Exclusive**: Only the reservation holder can modify matching files\n- **Shared**: Multiple agents can read, one can write with coordination\n\nReservations are TTL-based to prevent deadlocks from crashed or stuck agents.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Reservation Model\n```typescript\ninterface FileReservation {\n  id: string;                    // UUID\n  projectId: string;             // Project scope\n  agentId: string;               // Reserving agent\n  patterns: string[];            // Glob patterns\n  mode: 'exclusive' | 'shared';  // Reservation type\n  ttl: number;                   // Time-to-live in seconds\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n  renewCount: number;            // Number of renewals\n  metadata: {\n    reason?: string;             // Why reserved\n    taskId?: string;             // Associated task\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Glob Pattern Matching\nUses `micromatch` for fast, accurate glob matching:\n```typescript\n// Example patterns\n'src/**/*.ts'           // All TypeScript in src\n'!src/**/*.test.ts'     // Exclude tests\n'packages/core/src/*'   // Direct children only\n'**/{package,tsconfig}.json'  // Specific files anywhere\n```\n\n### Core Operations\n\n#### 1. Create Reservation\n```typescript\nasync createReservation(params: {\n  projectId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  patterns: string[];\n  mode: 'exclusive' | 'shared';\n  ttl?: number;          // Default: 300 (5 minutes)\n  reason?: string;\n}): Promise<{\n  reservation: FileReservation;\n  conflicts: ConflictInfo[];  // Empty if granted\n  granted: boolean;\n}>\n```\n\n#### 2. Check Reservation\n```typescript\nasync checkReservation(params: {\n  projectId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  filePath: string;\n}): Promise<{\n  allowed: boolean;\n  heldBy?: string;        // Agent holding reservation\n  expiresAt?: Date;\n  mode?: 'exclusive' | 'shared';\n}>\n```\n\n#### 3. Release Reservation\n```typescript\nasync releaseReservation(params: {\n  reservationId: string;\n  agentId: string;        // Must match holder\n}): Promise<{ released: boolean }>\n```\n\n#### 4. Renew Reservation\n```typescript\nasync renewReservation(params: {\n  reservationId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  additionalTtl?: number; // Default: original TTL\n}): Promise<{\n  renewed: boolean;\n  newExpiresAt: Date;\n}>\n```\n\n#### 5. List Reservations\n```typescript\nasync listReservations(params: {\n  projectId: string;\n  agentId?: string;       // Filter by agent\n  filePath?: string;      // Filter by affected file\n}): Promise<FileReservation[]>\n```\n\n### Conflict Detection Algorithm\n\nWhen a new reservation is requested:\n1. Expand all patterns to a set of potential file paths\n2. For each existing reservation in the project:\n   a. Expand its patterns\n   b. Compute intersection with new patterns\n   c. If intersection non-empty AND modes conflict, record conflict\n3. Return conflicts or grant reservation\n\n```typescript\nfunction detectConflicts(\n  newPatterns: string[],\n  newMode: ReservationMode,\n  existingReservations: FileReservation[]\n): ConflictInfo[] {\n  const conflicts: ConflictInfo[] = [];\n  \n  for (const existing of existingReservations) {\n    const overlap = computePatternOverlap(newPatterns, existing.patterns);\n    \n    if (overlap.length > 0) {\n      // Exclusive conflicts with everything\n      // Shared only conflicts with exclusive\n      if (existing.mode === 'exclusive' || newMode === 'exclusive') {\n        conflicts.push({\n          reservationId: existing.id,\n          agentId: existing.agentId,\n          overlappingPatterns: overlap,\n          expiresAt: existing.expiresAt\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return conflicts;\n}\n```\n\n### TTL Management\n\n- Background job runs every 10 seconds\n- Expired reservations are marked and cleaned\n- Agents can subscribe to expiration warnings (30s before)\n- Maximum TTL: 1 hour (configurable)\n- Maximum renewals: 10 (prevents indefinite locks)\n\n## UI Components\n\n### Reservation Map View\nVisual representation of current reservations:\n```\nProject: flywheel-gateway\n==========================\n\n[Agent: architect-001] (exclusive, expires in 4:32)\n  - src/services/**/*.ts\n  - src/models/**/*.ts\n\n[Agent: coder-002] (shared, expires in 2:15)\n  - src/utils/*.ts\n  - src/helpers/*.ts\n\n[Agent: tester-003] (exclusive, expires in 8:45)\n  - **/*.test.ts\n  - **/*.spec.ts\n\nConflicts: None\n```\n\n### Real-time Updates\n- WebSocket subscription for reservation changes\n- Live conflict notifications\n- Expiration countdown timers\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/reservation.service.ts` | Core reservation logic |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/reservation.types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/reservation.store.ts` | Storage abstraction |\n| `apps/gateway/src/services/pattern-matcher.ts` | Glob pattern utilities |\n| `apps/gateway/src/controllers/reservation.controller.ts` | REST API endpoints |\n| `apps/gateway/src/websocket/reservation.gateway.ts` | WebSocket handlers |\n| `apps/gateway/src/jobs/reservation-cleanup.job.ts` | TTL enforcement |\n| `apps/web/src/components/ReservationMap.tsx` | UI component |\n| `apps/gateway/src/__tests__/reservation.service.test.ts` | Unit tests |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Create, check, release, renew, list operations\n- [ ] Glob pattern matching with negation support\n- [ ] Exclusive vs shared mode semantics\n- [ ] Conflict detection for overlapping patterns\n- [ ] TTL-based automatic expiration\n- [ ] Maximum renewal limit enforcement\n- [ ] REST API endpoints for all operations\n- [ ] WebSocket events for real-time updates\n- [ ] Reservation map UI component\n- [ ] Background cleanup job for expired reservations\n- [ ] >95% test coverage for conflict detection\n- [ ] Performance: <50ms for conflict check with 100 active reservations\n- [ ] Documentation with usage examples\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md Section 11: File Coordination\n- PLAN.md Section 12: Conflict Prevention\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `micromatch` - Glob pattern matching\n- `ioredis` - Redis for distributed state\n- `cron` - Background job scheduling\n- Socket.io for WebSocket support\n\n## Edge Cases to Handle\n\n1. Agent requests pattern that is subset of own existing reservation\n2. Agent crashes without releasing reservation\n3. Two agents request overlapping patterns simultaneously\n4. Pattern expansion exceeds memory limits (cap at 10,000 files)\n5. Reservation renewal race conditions\n6.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-5nq","title":"FEAT: DCG Integration (Destructive Command Guard)","description":"## Background\n\nDCG (Destructive Command Guard) is an external Rust binary and shell hook that **mechanically enforces command safety** at the exact execution boundary. It blocks dangerous commands (or warns) *before* they run, with very low latency.\n\nFlywheel Gateway’s job is **integration and visibility**, not re-implementing DCG.\n\n- DCG already blocks: destructive git ops, dangerous filesystem ops, risky DB commands, etc.\n- Gateway must surface DCG decisions in the agent UX, preserve an audit trail, and provide UI to manage allowlists/config.\n\n## Goals\n\n1. **Visibility**: show DCG blocks/warnings inline in agent output and in a dedicated dashboard.\n2. **Governance**: manage per-project / per-agent allowlists and enabled packs via UI + REST.\n3. **Safety workflow**: route high-severity blocks into the SLB approval queue; critical blocks are always denied.\n4. **Learning loop**: capture false-positive feedback and feed it into CM (Cass-Memory) to reduce repeats.\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Rebuilding DCG’s pack/pattern engine in TypeScript.\n- Providing a bypass mechanism that defeats DCG’s mechanical enforcement.\n\n## Data Model (source of truth)\n\n```ts\n// packages/shared/src/types/dcg.ts\n\nexport interface DCGBlockEvent {\n  id: string;\n  timestamp: Date;\n  agentId: string;\n  command: string;\n  pack: string;

count: number }>;\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Architecture\n\nGateway integrates DCG in three places:\n\n1. **Agent execution boundary** (AgentDriver)\n   - When agents execute commands, DCG may emit block/warn output.\n   - Gateway must detect DCG outcomes and convert them into structured `DCGBlockEvent` records.\n\n2. **Storage + API** (Gateway backend)\n   - Persist block events.\n   - Expose REST endpoints for config, allowlists, packs, history, and stats.\n\n3. **Realtime + UI**\n   - Publish `dcg.block` / `dcg.warn` events via the WebSocket layer (flywheel_gateway-46c).\n   - Provide a dashboard to view recent blocks, stats, pack configuration, and allowlist management.\n\n### REST API Endpoints (PLAN.md §17.6.3)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/dcg/config` | Get DCG configuration |\n| `PUT` | `/dcg/config` | Update DCG configuration |\n| `GET` | `/dcg/packs` | List available packs |\n| `POST` | `/dcg/packs/{pack}/enable` | Enable a pack |\n| `POST` | `/dcg/packs/{pack}/disable` | Disable a pack |\n| `GET` | `/dcg/blocks` | List block history |\n| `POST` | `/dcg/blocks/{id}/false-positive` | Mark as false positive |\n| `GET` | `/dcg/allowlist` | List allowlist entries |\n| `POST` | `/dcg/allowlist` | Add allowlist entry |\n| `DELETE` | `/dcg/allowlist/{ruleId}` | Remove allowlist entry |\n| `GET` | `/dcg/stats` | Get block statistics |\n\n### WebSocket Events (PLAN.md §17.6.4)\n\n```ts\ninterface DCGEvent {\n  type: 'dcg.block' | 'dcg.warn' | 'dcg.allowlist_added' | 'dcg.false_positive';\n  data: DCGBlockEvent | DCGAllowlistEntry;\n}\n```\n\n## UX Requirements\n\n- DCG blocks must be visually distinct in output streams (severity badge + reason + ruleId).\n- UI must make it obvious when something is **not allowlistable** (e.g., severity `critical`).\n- Allowlist actions must require an explicit reason and should be audited.\n- False-positive marking must be one click but recorded with actor + timestamp.\n\n## Safety / Security Considerations\n\n- Redact secrets in `command` (and any captured context).\n- Never log OAuth tokens / API keys / secrets.\n- Pagination and filtering required on `/dcg/blocks`.\n- Any config change should be versioned and auditable.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Gateway can ingest DCG block/warn outcomes into `DCGBlockEvent` with stable schema.\n- [ ] `/dcg/*` endpoints exist and are consistent with the shared types.\n- [ ] WebSocket publishes dcg events to subscribed clients.\n- [ ] UI dashboard shows recent blocks + stats and supports allowlist + false-positive flows.\n- [ ] SLB integration: `high` severity blocks can be queued for approval;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-5sq","title":"DCG: Implement Pending Exceptions (Allow-Once)","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nDCG supports \"pending exceptions\" (allow-once workflow) where users can approve a blocked command for single execution using a short code. This enables users to bypass false positives without permanently allowlisting dangerous patterns.\n\n## Background\n\nDCG's pending exception workflow:\n1. DCG blocks a command and generates a short code (e.g., \"abc123\")\n2. User reviews the blocked command and decides it's safe\n3. User runs `dcg allow abc123` to approve single execution\n4. DCG allows that specific command+SHA256 hash once\n5. If same command runs again, it requires new approval\n\n### Current State\n\nThe Gateway has no implementation for this workflow. Users must:\n- SSH to server directly\n- Run CLI commands manually\n- No visibility into pending exceptions\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-61i","title":"Agent Mail Integration (MCP Client)","description":"## Background\n\nAgent Mail provides MCP-based (Model Context Protocol) inter-agent communication within the Flywheel ecosystem. This enables agents to collaborate, delegate tasks, share context, and coordinate their activities without requiring direct connections.\n\nThe mail system uses a message queue architecture where agents send messages to named mailboxes. This decouples senders from receivers and enables asynchronous communication patterns essential for multi-agent orchestration.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### MCP Integration\nAgent Mail is exposed as an MCP server that agents connect to as clients. This leverages the standard MCP tool-calling mechanism for all mail operations:\n\n```typescript\n// MCP Tools exposed by Agent Mail\ntools: [\n  'agentmail_ensure_project',    // Create/verify project exists\n  'agentmail_register_agent',    // Register agent in project\n  'agentmail_send_message',      // Send message to agent\n  'agentmail_reply',             // Reply to received message\n  'agentmail_fetch_inbox',       // Get pending messages\n  'agentmail_request_file_reservation'  // Request file lock\n]\n```\n\n### Message Structure\n```typescript\ninterface AgentMailMessage {\n  id: string;                    // UUID\n  projectId: string;             // Project context\n  from: AgentIdentity;           // Sender agent\n  to: AgentIdentity;             // Recipient agent\n  subject: string;               // Message subject\n  body: any;                     // Structured content (JSON)\n  replyTo?: string;              // Parent message ID for threads\n  priority: 'low' | 'normal' | 'high' | 'urgent';\n  ttl: number;                   // Time-to-live in seconds\n  metadata: Record<string, any>; // Extension point\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Core Operations\n\n#### 1. Ensure Project\nIdempotently creates a project context for agent communication:\n```typescript\nagentmail_ensure_project({\n  projectId: string,\n  name: string,\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>\n}): { projectId: string, created: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 2. Register Agent\nRegisters an agent to receive messages in a project:\n```typescript\nagentmail_register_agent({\n  projectId: string,\n  agentId: string,\n  capabilities: string[],\n  metadata?: Record<string, any>\n}): { registered: boolean, mailboxId: string }\n```\n\n#### 3. Send Message\nSends a message to another agent's mailbox:\n```typescript\nagentmail_send_message({\n  projectId: string,\n  to: string,           // Agent ID\n  subject: string,\n  body: any,\n  priority?: Priority,\n  ttl?: number          // Default: 3600 (1 hour)\n}): { messageId: string, delivered: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 4. Reply\nReplies to a received message, maintaining thread context:\n```typescript\nagentmail_reply({\n  messageId: string,    // Original message to reply to\n  body: any,\n  priority?: Priority\n}): { replyId: string, delivered: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 5. Fetch Inbox\nRetrieves pending messages for an agent:\n```typescript\nagentmail_fetch_inbox({\n  projectId: string,\n  agentId: string,\n  limit?: number,       // Default: 50\n  since?: Date,\n  priority?: Priority   // Filter by priority\n}): { messages: AgentMailMessage[], hasMore: boolean }\n```\n\n#### 6. Request File Reservation\nRequests a file reservation through the mail system:\n```typescript\nagentmail_request_file_reservation({\n  projectId: string,\n  requesterId: string,\n  patterns: string[],   // Glob patterns\n  exclusive: boolean,\n  duration: number      // Seconds\n}): { reservationId: string, granted: boolean, conflicts?: string[] }\n```\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### MCP Server Configuration\n```typescript\nconst mcpServer = new MCPServer({\n  name: 'flywheel-agentmail',\n  version: '1.0.0',\n  capabilities: {\n    tools: true,\n    resources: false,\n    prompts: false\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Message Queue Backend\n- In-memory queue for development\n- Redis-backed queue for production\n- PostgreSQL for message persistence and history\n- Configurable retention policies\n\n### Delivery Guarantees\n- At-least-once delivery with idempotency keys\n- Dead letter queue for undeliverable messages\n- Retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)\n- Delivery confirmation via acknowledgment\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/index.ts` | Public exports |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/mcp-server.ts` | MCP server implementation |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/tools/` | Individual MCP tool handlers |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/queue.ts` | Message queue abstraction |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/storage/` | Storage adapters (memory, Redis, Postgres) |\n| `packages/flywheel-clients/src/agentmail/__tests__/` | Test suites |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] MCP server with all 6 tools implemented\n- [ ] Tool input/output schema validation\n- [ ] Message persistence across restarts\n- [ ] Thread support via replyTo chains\n- [ ] Priority queue ordering (urgent > high > normal > low)\n- [ ] TTL enforcement with automatic expiration\n- [ ] Dead letter queue for failed deliveries\n- [ ] At-least-once delivery guarantee\n- [ ] Redis adapter for production\n- [ ] PostgreSQL adapter for persistence\n- [ ] >90% test coverage\n- [ ] Integration tests with mock agents\n- [ ] Performance: handle 1000 msgs/sec\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md Section 10: Inter-Agent Communication\n- PLAN.md Section 11: Agent Mail Protocol\n- MCP Specification: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP SDK\n- `ioredis` - Redis client\n- `pg` - PostgreSQL client\n- Shared types from `@flywheel/types`\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Validate agent identity before message access\n- Enforce project-level isolation\n- Rate limit message sending (default: 100/min/agent)\n- Sanitize message body content\n- Encrypt sensitive message content at rest\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Client request/response schemas validate and map errors into shared taxonomy\n- [ ] Availability/health caching behaves as intended (TTL, invalidate)\n- [ ] Macro helpers (start session, reservations cycle) compose correctly\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Against a local/mock Agent Mail server: ensure_project/register_agent/send_message/fetch_inbox work end-to-end\n- [ ] File reservation conflict scenarios are handled and surfaced to callers with clear details\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Server unreachable/timeouts → graceful degradation and actionable error hints\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite;

Users need to see this output in real-time for interactive workflows, while also being able to retrieve historical output for review and debugging.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n### Why Real-time Streaming?\n- **User Experience**: Watching output appear live is essential for interactive agent use\n- **Progress Visibility**: Long-running operations show incremental progress\n- **Early Termination**: Users can stop agents early if output shows wrong direction\n- **Debugging**: See exactly what the agent is doing as it works\n\n### Why Output Buffering?\n- **Reconnection Support**: Users can disconnect and reconnect without losing output\n- **Historical Review**: Examine what an agent did after the fact\n- **Sharing**: Share output logs with teammates for collaboration\n- **Compliance**: Some use cases require output retention for audit\n\n### Why Separate REST + WebSocket?\n- **WebSocket for Live**: Low-latency push of new output chunks\n- **REST for History**: Simple retrieval of past output with pagination\n- **Flexibility**: Clients choose their consumption pattern\n- **Graceful Degradation**: REST works even if WebSocket fails\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### PTY Output Handling\n```typescript\ninterface OutputChunk {\n  id: string;              // UUID v7 for ordering\n  agentId: string;\n  sessionId: string;\n  timestamp: string;       // ISO 8601\n  streamType: 'stdout' | 'stderr' | 'system';\n  content: string;         // Raw output content\n  encoding: 'utf-8' | 'base64'; // Base64 for binary\n  sequence: number;        // Monotonic sequence number\n}\n```\n\n### Buffering Strategy\n- **Ring Buffer**: Keep last N chunks in memory (configurable, default 1000)\n- **Persistence**: Write to database for long-term storage\n- **Compression**: Compress older chunks to save space\n- **TTL**: Auto-delete output older than retention period\n\n### Streaming Implementation\n1. PTY data event fires\n2. Parse into output chunks\n3. Assign sequence number and timestamp\n4. Emit to WebSocket subscribers\n5. Push to ring buffer\n6. Async persist to database\n\n### WebSocket Protocol\n```typescript\n// Client subscribes to agent output\n{ type: 'subscribe', agentId: 'uuid' }\n\n// Server pushes output chunks\n{ \n  type: 'output.chunk', \n  agentId: 'uuid',\n  chunk: OutputChunk \n}\n\n// Client can request backfill\n{ type: 'output.backfill', agentId: 'uuid', fromSequence: 42 }\n```\n\n### REST Endpoint Design\n```\nGET /api/v1/agents/:agentId/output\nQuery params:\n  - limit: number (default 100, max 1000)\n  - cursor: string (for pagination)\n  - since: ISO timestamp (filter by time)\n  - streamType: stdout | stderr | system (filter by type)\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"chunks\": [...],\n  \"cursor\": \"next-page-token\",\n  \"hasMore\": true\n}\n```\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- **Batching**: Group rapid output into larger chunks (every 50ms)\n- **Backpressure**: Handle slow consumers without blocking PTY\n- **Memory Limits**: Cap total buffer size per agent\n- **Connection Limits**: Max WebSocket connections per agent\n\n### Output Processing\n- **ANSI Parsing**: Optionally strip or preserve ANSI codes\n- **Line Detection**: Identify complete lines for structured display\n- **Content Detection**: Flag potential secrets in output\n- **Size Limits**: Truncate extremely large output chunks\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] PTY stdout/stderr is captured as output chunks\n- [ ] WebSocket endpoint accepts output subscriptions\n- [ ] Subscribed clients receive output chunks in real-time (<100ms latency)\n- [ ] Ring buffer retains configurable number of recent chunks\n- [ ] REST endpoint returns paginated output history\n- [ ] Cursor-based pagination works correctly\n- [ ] Output chunks include sequence numbers for ordering\n- [ ] Clients can request backfill from specific sequence\n- [ ] Large output is batched to reduce message frequency\n- [ ] ANSI codes are preserved in raw output\n- [ ] Memory usage stays bounded under high output load\n- [ ] Unit tests for ring buffer operations\n- [ ] Integration test for subscribe -> receive flow\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Core Service\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/output.service.ts` - Output capture and distribution\n\n### Buffering\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/output-buffer.ts` - Ring buffer implementation\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/output-persistence.ts` - Database persistence\n\n### WebSocket\n- `apps/gateway/src/websocket/output-streaming.ts` - WebSocket handlers\n- `apps/gateway/src/websocket/subscriptions.ts` - Subscription management\n\n### REST\n- `apps/gateway/src/routes/output.routes.ts` - Output endpoint registration\n- `apps/gateway/src/controllers/output.controller.ts` - Output retrieval handler\n\n### Types\n- `packages/shared-types/src/output.types.ts` - Output chunk interfaces\n\n### Utilities\n- `apps/gateway/src/utils/ansi-parser.ts` - ANSI code handling\n\n## Reference\n\n- PLAN.md §19: Output Management\n- xterm.js integration patterns\n- WebSocket streaming best practices\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Ring buffer append/trim logic preserves ordering and enforces size limits\n- [ ] Cursor semantics: resume from cursor returns exactly-once stream slice\n- [ ] Backpressure strategy (drop/slow/queue) behaves deterministically under load\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Stream output over WebSocket; disconnect/reconnect with cursor → no gaps, no duplicates\n- [ ] Output polling endpoint returns consistent results with the streaming buffer\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Cursor expired → correct error code + hint; client can recover by full reload\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + agentId + cursor + buffer sizes; output content is not logged\n\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:31:58.527296664Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:27:15.411982741Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:27:15.411982741Z","close_reason":"Core implementation complete: ring buffer, cursor-based pagination, WebSocket publishing, spawn/terminate hooks, 17 tests passing.

Fixed by capturing batchStartIteration before map callback.\n\n2. **Parallel loop race condition** - Iterations overwrote each other's variables. Added isolated mode with indexed keys.\n\n3. **Loop step re-execution** - Steps only ran once across all iterations due to executedStepIds check. Added __loopDepth context variable to allow re-execution inside loops.\n\n4. **Loop result capture** - Used wrong context key (_step_X_result vs step_X_output). Fixed to use correct key.\n\n5. **Webhook fetch type error** - body: undefined incompatible with RequestInit. Fixed with body ?? null.\n\n6. **Transform count accuracy** - transformedCount incremented even for no-ops. Now only counts successful transforms.\n\n7. **executedStepIds duplicates** - Array grew with duplicates in loops. Added includes check before push.\n\n8. **RetryError.cause conflict** - Conflicted with ES2022 Error.cause. Renamed to originalCause.\n\n9. **Headers.entries() compat** - TypeScript compatibility.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-6mn","title":"FEAT: Database Schema and Drizzle Setup","description":"## Overview\n\nflywheel_gateway uses **SQLite with Drizzle ORM** for persistent storage. This combination provides type-safe database access, automatic migration management, and excellent performance for the gateway's workload characteristics. WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode enables concurrent read/write access without blocking.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\n### Why SQLite?\n\n1. **Simplicity**: Single-file database with no external dependencies\n2. **Bun-Native**: First-class SQLite support in Bun runtime via `bun:sqlite`\n3. **Performance**: Sub-millisecond queries for typical workloads\n4. **WAL Mode**: Concurrent readers don't block writers (and vice versa)\n5. **Portability**: Easy backup, replication, and disaster recovery\n6. **Proven Scale**: SQLite handles millions of rows with proper indexing\n\n### Why Drizzle ORM?\n\n1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript inference from schema to queries\n2. **SQL-Like API**: Familiar syntax, no magic strings\n3. **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit generates and applies migrations\n4. **Performance**: Minimal overhead compared to raw SQL\n5. **Bun Support**: Native integration with Bun's SQLite driver\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Database Tables\n\nAll tables from PLAN.md §29.1:\n\n#### Core Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `agents` | Active and historical agent records | id, repoUrl, task, status, model, createdAt |\n| `checkpoints` | Agent state snapshots for resume | id, agentId, state, createdAt |\n| `accounts` | User accounts and API keys | id, email, apiKeyHash, role, createdAt |\n| `history` | Command execution history | id, agentId, command, input, output, durationMs |\n\n#### Monitoring & Audit Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `alerts` | System alerts and notifications | id, severity, message, acknowledged, createdAt |\n| `auditLogs` | Security and compliance audit trail | id, accountId, action, resource, metadata, createdAt |\n\n#### DCG (Derived Code Governance) Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `dcgBlocks` | Blocked operations and reasons | id, pattern, reason, createdBy, createdAt |\n| `dcgAllowlist` | Explicitly allowed operations | id, pattern, approvedBy, expiresAt |\n\n#### Fleet Management Tables\n\n| Table | Purpose | Key Columns |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| `fleetRepos` | Repositories in the managed fleet | id, url, branch, lastSyncAt, status |\n| `agentSweeps` | Bulk agent operations | id, query, action, status, affectedCount |\n\n### Schema Definition\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts\nimport { sqliteTable, text, integer, blob } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';\n\nexport const agents = sqliteTable('agents', {\n  id: text('id').primaryKey(),\n  repoUrl: text('repo_url').notNull(),\n  task: text('task').notNull(),\n  status: text('status').notNull().default('idle'),\n  model: text('model').notNull().default('sonnet-4'),\n  accountId: text('account_id').references(() => accounts.id),\n  createdAt: integer('created_at', { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),\n  updatedAt: integer('updated_at', { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),\n});\n\nexport const checkpoints = sqliteTable('checkpoints', {\n  id: text('id').primaryKey(),\n  agentId: text('agent_id').references(() => agents.id).notNull(),\n  state: blob('state', { mode: 'json' }).notNull(),\n  createdAt: integer('created_at', { mode: 'timestamp' }).notNull(),\n});\n\n// ... additional tables\n```\n\n### Index Strategy\n\nIndexes are created for frequently queried columns:\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts\nimport { index } from 'drizzle-orm/sqlite-core';\n\nexport const agentsIndexes = {\n  statusIdx: index('agents_status_idx').on(agents.status),\n  accountIdx: index('agents_account_idx').on(agents.accountId),\n  createdAtIdx: index('agents_created_at_idx').on(agents.createdAt),\n};\n\nexport const historyIndexes = {\n  agentIdx: index('history_agent_idx').on(history.agentId),\n  commandIdx: index('history_command_idx').on(history.command),\n  createdAtIdx: index('history_created_at_idx').on(history.createdAt),\n};\n\nexport const auditLogsIndexes = {\n  accountIdx: index('audit_logs_account_idx').on(auditLogs.accountId),\n  actionIdx: index('audit_logs_action_idx').on(auditLogs.action),\n  createdAtIdx: index('audit_logs_created_at_idx').on(auditLogs.createdAt),\n};\n```\n\n### Drizzle-kit for Migrations\n\n```typescript\n// drizzle.config.ts\nimport type { Config } from 'drizzle-kit';\n\nexport default {\n  schema: './apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts',\n  out: './apps/gateway/src/db/migrations',\n  driver: 'bun-sqlite',\n  dbCredentials: {\n    url: './data/gateway.db',\n  },\n} satisfies Config;\n```\n\nMigration commands:\n- `bun drizzle-kit generate` - Generate migration from schema changes\n- `bun drizzle-kit migrate` - Apply pending migrations\n- `bun drizzle-kit push` - Push schema directly (dev only)\n\n### WAL Mode Configuration\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/db/connection.ts\nimport { Database } from 'bun:sqlite';\nimport { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/bun-sqlite';\n\nconst sqlite = new Database('./data/gateway.db');\nsqlite.exec('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL');\nsqlite.exec('PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL');\nsqlite.exec('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON');\n\nexport const db = drizzle(sqlite);\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n```\napps/gateway/src/db/\n├── schema.ts            # Table definitions\n├── indexes.ts           # Index definitions\n├── connection.ts        # Database connection setup\n├── migrations/          # Generated migrations\n│   ├── 0000_initial.sql\n│   ├── 0001_add_dcg_tables.sql\n│   └── meta/\n└── queries/\n    ├── agents.ts        # Agent-related queries\n    ├── checkpoints.ts   # Checkpoint queries\n    ├── accounts.ts      # Account queries\n    └── audit.ts         # Audit log queries\n```\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n\n- [ ] Schema validation tests\n  -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-6pm","title":"Improve CAAM auth management to align with BYOA/BYOK plan","description":"## Background\n\nCAAM (\"CAAM Account & Profile Management\") is the subsystem that manages user/provider accounts, authentication material, and profile selection for agent execution. The project goals include:\n\n- **BYOA (Bring Your Own Accounts):** Users can connect their own provider accounts (Anthropic/OpenAI/etc).\n- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys):** Users can supply API keys (and rotate them) without leaking secrets into logs, artifacts, or UI.\n\nThis issue existed to ensure our CAAM auth management (storage, APIs, UI flows, logging, and test coverage) aligns with those goals and the overall safety posture of Flywheel Gateway.\n\n## What This Task Covered\n\n1. **Auth material handling model**\n   - Define what “auth material” is (API keys, OAuth tokens, refresh tokens, device-code sessions, etc.).\n   - Establish how auth material is stored and referenced (indirection via an internal secret reference, never direct echo in responses).\n\n2. **Rotation as a first-class workflow**\n   - Model key/token rotation as an explicit operation with audit events.\n   - Ensure rotation does not silently break running agents; document expected behavior.\n\n3. **Logging and redaction requirements**\n   - Ensure request/response logs and test logs never contain secrets.\n   - Ensure structured logs include stable identifiers (`accountId`, `profileId`, `workspaceId`, `correlationId`).\n\n4. **User experience alignment**\n   - Clarify the intended UX: guided onboarding, explicit copy around persistence, and clear recovery guidance for common auth failures.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] CAAM auth flows are explicitly documented and aligned with BYOA/BYOK goals (what is stored, where, and how it is protected).\n- [ ] All auth material is treated as secret: never returned verbatim, never logged, and always redacted in artifacts.\n- [ ] Rotation is a supported workflow with clear semantics, auditability, and failure recovery guidance.\n- [ ] API surfaces and UI flows call out failure modes (revoked token, expired device code, missing scopes) and provide actionable recovery steps.\n- [ ] Follow-up gaps are captured as separate beads with clear scope.\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Secret redaction helper covers headers, payload fields, and nested JSON keys.\n- [ ] Rotation state machine: valid/invalid transitions and audit event emission.\n- [ ] CAAM connection health evaluation: maps provider errors to stable error codes.\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] CAAM auth lifecycle endpoints (create/update/rotate/test) validate inputs and never echo secrets.\n- [ ] Audit log entries exist for rotation and failed auth attempts.\n- [ ] Correlation IDs thread through CAAM requests and into audit events.\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Onboarding flow (mock provider): connect account → select profile → spawn agent using profile.\n- [ ] Failure flow: revoked/expired auth → UI shows recovery actions; no secrets leak in browser console or API logs.\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] All tests log `correlationId` and anonymized entity IDs; secrets are never logged.\n\n## Closure Notes\n\nThis issue is **closed**; remaining UX follow-ups were split into:\n\n- `flywheel_gateway-4ub`: CAAM auth UX follow-ups (device-code, import/upload guidance, BYOA onboarding copy)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-08T04:46:20.778720353Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T07:59:27.249084582Z","closed_at":"2026-01-08T15:49:50.513289968Z","close_reason":"Implemented CAAM auth management updates and synced docs","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
{"id":"flywheel_gateway-6wp","title":"FEAT: Agent Performance Analytics","description":"## Background\n\nUnderstanding individual agent performance is critical for optimizing the Flywheel ecosystem. Organizations need visibility into which agents are most productive, which models perform best for specific task types, and where bottlenecks exist. This bead implements comprehensive agent performance analytics with AI-powered recommendations to help operators continuously improve their agent fleet.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nAgent performance analytics serves multiple stakeholders:\n- **Operators**: Identify underperforming agents, optimize configurations\n- **Efficiency**: Understand usage drivers and optimize model selection\n- **Engineering**: Debug issues, improve agent prompts and tooling\n- **Management**: Track ROI, make informed scaling decisions\n\nThe analytics must go beyond simple metrics to provide actionable insights. This means:\n- Aggregating raw events into meaningful KPIs\n- Comparing performance across dimensions (model, task type, time)\n- Detecting anomalies and trends automatically\n- Generating human-readable recommendations\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Productivity Metrics\n\n**Tasks Completed:**\n- Count of tasks reaching terminal state (completed, failed, cancelled)\n- Breakdown by outcome: success vs failure vs timeout\n- Rolling averages: hourly, daily, weekly\n- Comparison to fleet average and historical self\n\n**Success Rate:**\n```typescript\ninterface SuccessRateMetric {\n  agent_id: string;\n  period: '1h' | '24h' | '7d' | '30d';\n  total_tasks: number;\n  successful_tasks: number;\n  success_rate: number;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-76h","title":"FEAT: Supervisor & Daemon Management","description":"## Overview\n\nFlywheel Gateway depends on several local background services (e.g., Agent Mail MCP server, cm, and bd’s daemon mode). This feature adds a **Supervisor** that can start/stop/restart these daemons, surface their health/logs, and emit real-time WebSocket events so the UI can show system readiness and failures.\n\nThis is primarily a **DX + reliability** feature: it reduces “why is nothing working?” time by making dependencies observable and recoverable from the Gateway itself.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nFlywheel Gateway is an orchestration hub. If prerequisite daemons aren’t running (or crash mid-session), downstream features fail in confusing ways. A first-class Supervisor provides:\n\n- Explicit status/health of required daemons\n- Automatic restarts under a clear policy\n- Log access for diagnosis\n- Real-time UI visibility via WebSocket events\n\n## Scope & Requirements\n\n### Supervisor Service (from `docs/PLAN.md` §5)\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/services/supervisor.service.ts\n\ninterface DaemonSpec {\n  name: string;\n  command: string[];\n  port?: number;\n  healthEndpoint?: string;\n  restartPolicy: 'always' | 'on-failure' | 'never';\n  maxRestarts: number;\n  restartDelayMs: number;\n}\n\nconst DEFAULT_SPECS: DaemonSpec[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'agent-mail',\n    command: ['mcp-agent-mail', 'serve'],\n    port: 8765,\n    healthEndpoint: '/health',\n    restartPolicy: 'always',\n    maxRestarts: 5,\n    restartDelayMs: 1000,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'cm-server',\n    command: ['cm', 'serve'],\n    port: 8766,\n    healthEndpoint: '/health',\n    restartPolicy: 'always',\n    maxRestarts: 5,\n    restartDelayMs: 1000,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'bd-daemon',\n    command: ['bd', 'daemon'],\n    restartPolicy: 'on-failure',\n    maxRestarts: 3,\n    restartDelayMs: 2000,\n  },\n];\n\ninterface DaemonState {\n  name: string;\n  status: 'starting' | 'running' | 'stopping' | 'stopped' | 'failed';\n  pid?: number;\n  port?: number;\n  startedAt?: Date;\n  restartCount: number;\n  lastHealthCheck?: Date;\n  lastError?: string;\n}\n\nexport class SupervisorService {\n  private daemons = new Map<string, DaemonState>();\n  private processes = new Map<string, Subprocess>();\n\n  async startAll(): Promise<void> {\n    for (const spec of DEFAULT_SPECS) {\n      await this.startDaemon(spec);\n    }\n  }\n\n  async startDaemon(spec: DaemonSpec): Promise<void> {\n    const proc = Bun.spawn(spec.command, {\n      stdout: 'pipe',\n      stderr: 'pipe',\n      onExit: (proc, exitCode) => this.handleExit(spec, exitCode),\n    });\n\n    this.processes.set(spec.name, proc);\n    this.daemons.set(spec.name, {\n      name: spec.name,\n      status: 'starting',\n      pid: proc.pid,\n      port: spec.port,\n      startedAt: new Date(),\n      restartCount: 0,\n    });\n\n    // Start health check loop\n    if (spec.healthEndpoint) {\n      this.startHealthCheck(spec);\n    }\n  }\n\n  async stopDaemon(name: string): Promise<void> {\n    const proc = this.processes.get(name);\n    if (proc) {\n      proc.kill();\n      this.daemons.set(name, { ...this.daemons.get(name)!, status: 'stopped' });\n    }\n  }\n\n  async getStatus(): Promise<DaemonState[]> {\n    return Array.from(this.daemons.values());\n  }\n\n  private async handleExit(spec: DaemonSpec, exitCode: number | null): Promise<void> {\n    const state = this.daemons.get(spec.name)!;\n\n    if (\n      spec.restartPolicy === 'always' ||\n      (spec.restartPolicy === 'on-failure' && exitCode !== 0)\n    ) {\n      if (state.restartCount < spec.maxRestarts) {\n        state.restartCount++;\n        state.status = 'starting';\n        await Bun.sleep(spec.restartDelayMs);\n        await this.startDaemon(spec);\n      } else {\n        state.status = 'failed';\n        state.lastError = `Max restarts (${spec.maxRestarts}) exceeded`;\n        this.emitEvent('daemon.failed', state);\n      }\n    } else {\n      state.status = 'stopped';\n    }\n  }\n\n  private startHealthCheck(spec: DaemonSpec): void {\n    setInterval(async () => {\n      try {\n        const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:${spec.port}${spec.healthEndpoint}`);\n        const state = this.daemons.get(spec.name)!;\n        if (res.ok && state.status === 'starting') {\n          state.status = 'running';\n          this.emitEvent('daemon.started', state);\n        }\n        state.lastHealthCheck = new Date();\n      } catch {\n        // Health check failed - daemon may be starting or crashed\n      }\n    }, 5000);\n  }\n\n  private emitEvent(type: string, data: DaemonState): void {\n    // Emit to WebSocket hub\n    eventBus.emit({ type, data });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### REST Endpoints (from `docs/PLAN.md` §5)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/supervisor/status` | All daemon statuses |\n| `POST` | `/supervisor/{name}/start` | Start daemon |\n| `POST` | `/supervisor/{name}/stop` | Stop daemon |\n| `POST` | `/supervisor/{name}/restart` | Restart daemon |\n| `GET` | `/supervisor/{name}/logs` | Daemon logs |\n\n### WebSocket Events (from `docs/PLAN.md` §5)\n\n```typescript\ninterface SupervisorEvent {\n  type: 'daemon.started' | 'daemon.stopped' | 'daemon.failed' | 'daemon.health_changed';\n  data: {\n    name: string;\n    status: DaemonState['status'];\n    pid?: number;\n    error?: string;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Safety / UX Constraints\n\n- The supervisor must **only** manage an allowlisted set of daemon specs (no arbitrary command execution from user input).\n- Daemon logs must be redacted for secrets; log streaming should be bounded.\n- UI must clearly distinguish “Gateway is running” vs “Gateway is ready (dependencies healthy)”.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Supervisor can start/stop/restart each allowlisted daemon and surfaces status + restart counts.\n- [ ] Health checks transition daemons from `starting` → `running` and emit WS events.\n- [ ] Failures (exit code / max restarts exceeded) are visible via REST and emitted via WS.\n- [ ] Logs endpoint returns recent daemon output with bounded size and redaction.\n- [ ] UI page shows daemon list, status, actions, and recent errors.\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Restart policy correctness (`always`, `on-failure`, `never`) including max restarts and delays\n- [ ] Health check transitions + `daemon.started` emission\n- [ ] Exit handling updates `DaemonState` and emits `daemon.failed`\n- [ ] Allowlist enforcement: unknown daemon name rejected with actionable error\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Supervisor can run a stub daemon (fixture process) and capture stdout/stderr\n- [ ] `/supervisor/status` reflects lifecycle transitions\n- [ ] `/supervisor/{name}/logs` returns bounded, chronological output\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] UI: view status, start/stop/restart flows for a stub daemon\n- [ ] UI: failure path shows actionable guidance (missing binary, port in use)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Test logs include `daemonName`, `pid`, `exitCode`, `restartCount`, and `correlationId` (never secrets)\n\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:37:47.614724104Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T05:57:41.085773418Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T05:57:41.085773418Z","close_reason":"Implemented SupervisorService with daemon management, REST API endpoints, WebSocket events, and unit tests (23 tests passing)","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["phase-2","supervisor"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-76h","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-2ao","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:15Z","created_by":"import"}]}

logging\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. All API operations generate audit events automatically\n2. Correlation IDs propagate across all service calls\n3. Sensitive data is redacted according to configuration\n4. Export supports CSV and JSON formats with compression\n5. Retention policies can be configured per-category\n6. Search returns results within 2 seconds for 30-day queries\n7. ClickHouse receives audit events within 5 seconds\n8. Audit events are tamper-evident (cannot be modified after creation)\n9. Export jobs handle datasets up to 1M records\n10. UI provides intuitive search and filter interface\n11. Compliance report generation for SOC 2 audits\n12. Performance: < 5ms overhead per request for audit logging\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n- Unit tests for redaction service\n- Integration tests for correlation propagation\n- Load tests for high-volume audit logging\n- E2E tests for export functionality\n- Compliance tests for required audit fields\n\n## Reference\n\nPLAN.md section 24 - Audit Trail Hardening\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Redaction rules remove secrets deterministically and preserve non-sensitive context\n- [ ] Export formats (JSON/NDJSON) are schema-valid and stable across versions\n- [ ] Retention policies apply correctly without deleting required audit records\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Mutating operations create audit events with correlation IDs and can be queried via REST\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Export under load does not block core operations; partial failures return resumable job state\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + auditEventId + actor + entity; exported content is not logged\n\n","notes":"## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] AuditEvent: creates with all fields\n- [ ] AuditEvent: generates correlation ID\n- [ ] AuditEvent: serializes for storage\n- [ ] TamperDetection: computes hash chain\n- [ ] TamperDetection: verifies integrity\n- [ ] Export: formats as CSV\n- [ ] Export: formats as JSON\n- [ ] Retention: applies policy rules\n- [ ] Retention: archives old events\n- [ ] Search: full-text indexing\n- [ ] Search: filter by actor/resource\n- [ ] Redaction: sanitizes sensitive data\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Events persisted on API calls\n- [ ] Correlation ID flows through stack\n- [ ] Export generates valid file\n- [ ] Retention deletes expired events\n- [ ] Search returns matching events\n- [ ] Hash chain valid across events\n- [ ] Large export handled streaming\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] User action appears in audit log\n- [ ] Export downloaded in UI\n- [ ] Search finds historical event\n- [ ] Tamper detection alerts on mismatch\n\n### Performance Tests\n- [ ] Event logging <5ms overhead\n- [ ] Search <500ms for 1M events\n- [ ] Export 10k events <10s\n- [ ] Retention cleanup efficient\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Storage full: graceful handling\n- [ ] Corrupt event: isolated and flagged\n- [ ] Export timeout: partial file\n- [ ] Hash mismatch: alert and quarantine","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:59:36.299921252Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T20:51:46.187900276Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T20:51:46.187900276Z","close_reason":"Implemented comprehensive audit trail hardening: Enhanced audit types (AuditAction, ResourceType, AuditActor, AuditOperation, AuditChanges), AuditRedactionService for sensitive data sanitization (remove, mask, hash patterns), audit routes (search, export, retention policies, analytics), 83 unit tests passing.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-7n4","title":"Job Orchestration for Long-Running Operations","description":"## Background\n\nThe Job Orchestration system provides infrastructure for managing long-running operations that cannot complete within typical HTTP request timeouts. This includes context builds, codebase scans, exports, and other operations that may take seconds to minutes.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **User Experience**: Long-running operations need progress feedback. Users should see what is happening, not a spinning cursor.\n\n2. **Reliability**: Operations that span minutes need checkpointing and resume capability. Network blips should not require restart.\n\n3. **Resource Management**: Concurrent long operations need throttling. Unbounded parallelism leads to resource exhaustion.\n\n4. **Cancellation**: Users must be able to cancel operations. Runaway jobs waste resources and block progress.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Job Types\n\n```typescript\nenum JobType {\n  // Context operations\n  CONTEXT_BUILD = 'context_build',\n  CONTEXT_COMPACT = 'context_compact',\n  \n  // Scan operations\n  CODEBASE_SCAN = 'codebase_scan',\n  DEPENDENCY_SCAN = 'dependency_scan',\n  \n  // Export operations\n  SESSION_EXPORT = 'session_export',\n  BEAD_EXPORT = 'bead_export',\n  \n  // Import operations\n  CODEBASE_IMPORT = 'codebase_import',\n  MEMORY_IMPORT = 'memory_import',\n  \n  // Analysis operations\n  SEMANTIC_INDEX = 'semantic_index',\n  EMBEDDING_GENERATE = 'embedding_generate',\n  \n  // Maintenance operations\n  CHECKPOINT_COMPACT = 'checkpoint_compact',\n  CACHE_WARM = 'cache_warm'\n}\n\nenum

= 'completed',       // Successfully finished\n  FAILED = 'failed',             // Failed with error\n  CANCELLED = 'cancelled',       // User-cancelled\n  TIMEOUT = 'timeout'            // Exceeded

or PostgreSQL)\n- WebSocket gateway (for events)\n- Logger service\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Job Creation**\n   - [ ] Jobs can be created with type, input, and optional priority\n   - [ ] Jobs are assigned unique IDs (ULID)\n   - [ ] Jobs start in PENDING status\n   - [ ] job.created event is emitted\n\n2. **Job Execution**\n   - [ ] Jobs execute in priority order\n   - [ ] Concurrency limits are respected (global and per-type)\n   - [ ] Timeouts are enforced\n   - [ ] job.started event is emitted\n\n3. **Progress Tracking**\n   - [ ] Progress updates are persisted\n   - [ ] job.progress events are emitted\n   - [ ] Progress includes percentage and message\n\n4. **Cancellation**\n   - [ ] Jobs can be cancelled via API\n   - [ ] Handlers receive cancellation signal\n   - [ ] Cleanup is performed\n   - [ ] job.cancelled event is emitted\n\n5. **Error Handling**\n   - [ ] Failed jobs retry according to configuration\n   - [ ] Exponential backoff is applied\n   - [ ] job.failed event includes retry information\n   - [ ] Non-retryable errors stop immediately\n\n6. **Checkpointing**\n   - [ ] Long jobs can checkpoint state\n   - [ ] Resumed jobs start from checkpoint\n   - [ ] Checkpoints are cleaned up on completion\n\n7. **Observability**\n   - [ ] All job state changes emit events\n   - [ ] Prometheus metrics for job counts, durations, failures\n   - [ ] Logs include job ID context\n\n## Reference\n\n- PLAN.md Section 8.9 - Job Queue for Long Operations\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Job state machine (queued → running → completed/failed/cancelled) enforces valid transitions\n- [ ] Progress event buffering and cursoring are deterministic and replay-safe\n- [ ] Cancellation semantics stop work and mark terminal state consistently\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Start a long-running job → stream progress via WebSocket → fetch final result via REST\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Worker crash/restart resumes or fails jobs according to policy, without losing audit trail\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite; add a focused E2E spec if this feature introduces unique user workflows\n- [ ] Failure mode E2E validates actionable recovery UI/messages (with artifacts captured)\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + jobId + opName + timings; payloads are redacted\n\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:43:04.296814850Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:24:29.725811403Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:24:29.725811403Z","close_reason":"Implemented

Inconsistent usage confuses clients and makes automated handling more difficult.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**Identified Inconsistencies:**\n\n1. **DELETE returning 200 instead of 204:**\n   - `DELETE /reservations/:id` returns `200` with body (reservations.ts:479-483)\n   - Should return `204 No Content` for successful deletion\n\n2. **POST actions returning 200 instead of 201/202:**\n   - `POST /agents/:agentId/send` returns `200` (agents.ts:361)\n   - Should return `202 Accepted` (async processing)\n   - `POST /agents/:agentId/interrupt` returns `200` (agents.ts:388)\n   - Should return `202 Accepted` (signal sent, not completed)\n\n3. **409 Conflict overloaded:**\n   - Used for actual resource conflicts (correct)\n   - Also used for \"already resolved\" state (conflicts.ts:333-344)\n   - \"Already resolved\" should be `400 Bad Request` or `422 Unprocessable Entity`\n\n4. **Missing 201 for creates:**\n   - Some POST endpoints that create resources return `200`\n   - Should return `201 Created` with `Location` header\n\n### HTTP Status Code Standards\n\n**2xx Success:**\n- `200 OK`: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH with response body\n- `201 Created`: Successful POST that creates a resource\n- `202 Accepted`: Request accepted for async processing\n- `204 No Content`: Successful DELETE or PUT with no response body\n\n**4xx Client Errors:**\n- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request syntax or parameters\n- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required\n- `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated but not authorized\n- `404 Not Found`: Resource doesn't exist\n- `409 Conflict`: Request conflicts with current state\n- `422 Unprocessable Entity`: Valid syntax but semantic error\n- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limited\n\n**5xx Server Errors:**\n- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server error\n- `502 Bad Gateway`: Upstream service error\n- `503 Service Unavailable`: Temporarily unavailable\n\n## Goals\n1. **Correct Semantics**: Each status code used correctly\n2. **Consistency**: Same action = same status code\n3. **Predictability**: Clients can rely on status codes\n4. **Location Header**: 201 responses include Location\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Audit all endpoints for status code correctness\n- [ ] DELETE endpoints return 204 (or 200 if returning deleted resource)\n- [ ] POST creates return 201 with Location header\n- [ ] Async operations return 202\n- [ ] Tests verify correct status codes\n\n## Technical Approach\n1.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-8ll","title":"DCG: Deep CLI Integration (explain, test, scan)","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe Gateway needs deep integration with DCG CLI commands (`dcg explain`, `dcg test`, `dcg scan`) to provide rich context and proactive safety analysis beyond basic block detection.\n\n## Background\n\nDCG provides several powerful CLI commands:\n\n- **`dcg explain <command>`**: Explains what a command does and why it might be blocked\n- **`dcg test <command>`**: Dry-run to test if a command would be blocked\n- **`dcg scan <file>`**: Scans a script file for potentially dangerous commands\n- **`dcg list-packs`**: Lists all available rule packs\n- **`dcg pack-info <pack>`**: Detailed info about a specific pack\n\nCurrently, the Gateway only reacts to blocks after they happen. With CLI integration, we can:\n1. Proactively warn users before they run dangerous commands\n2. Scan agent-generated scripts before execution\n3. Provide educational context about why commands are dangerous\n4. Pre-validate commands in the UI before sending to agents\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1.

Create sweep with mixed safe/dangerous commands\n    const session = await startAgentSweep(\"test\", {\n      targetRepos: [\"test-repo\"],\n      autoApprove: false,\n    });\n\n    // Wait for

});\n});\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Plans are validated against DCG before execution\n- [ ] Dangerous commands are detected and block plan execution\n- [ ] Risk levels are correctly assessed from DCG findings\n- [ ] Pending exceptions can be created for blocked commands\n- [ ] Execution stops on DCG blocks\n- [ ] All blocks are logged with sweep session context\n- [ ] Frontend shows DCG validation status on plans\n- [ ] DCG summary visible on sweep session page\n- [ ] All unit tests pass with comprehensive logging\n- [ ] All integration tests pass\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Never auto-approve dangerous commands in sweeps\n- Require explicit user approval for each exception\n- Log all exception approvals with user identity\n- Rate limit exception creation to prevent abuse\n- Expire sweep-related exceptions after 1 hour\n","notes":"Implementation completed (2026-01-11):\n\nCreated:\n- apps/gateway/src/services/dcg-ru-integration.service.ts (706

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-bqs","title":"DCG Advanced Features","description":"## Overview\n\nDCG (Dangerous Command Guard) Advanced Features extends the core content safety system with administrative capabilities, feedback mechanisms, and analytics. This enables operators to fine-tune content filtering behavior and track safety metrics.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nThe base DCG implementation provides essential content filtering, but production deployments require:\n\n- Administrative control over allowlists and blocklists\n- Feedback loops to reduce false positives\n- Visibility into block statistics and patterns\n- Integration with CM (Claude Mind) for pattern learning\n\nThese advanced features transform DCG from a static filter into an adaptive safety system.\n\n## Feature Components\n\n### 1. Allowlist Management UI\n\nAdministrators need to manage exceptions for legitimate content that triggers false positives:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AllowlistEntry {\n  id: string;\n  pattern: string;           // Regex or exact match\n  matchType: 'exact' | 'regex' | 'contains';\n  scope: 'global' | 'repository' | 'agent';\n  scopeId?: string;          // Repository or agent ID if scoped\n  reason: string;            // Why this is allowed\n  createdBy: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;          // Optional expiration\n  usageCount: number;        // How often this rule matched\n}\n\ninterface AllowlistService {\n  addEntry(entry: CreateAllowlistEntry): Promise<AllowlistEntry>;\n  removeEntry(id: string): Promise<void>;\n  updateEntry(id: string, updates: Partial<AllowlistEntry>): Promise<AllowlistEntry>;\n  listEntries(scope?: AllowlistScope): Promise<AllowlistEntry[]>;\n  checkContent(content: string, context: ContentContext): Promise<AllowlistMatch | null>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. False Positive Feedback Loop\n\nWhen content is incorrectly blocked, users can submit feedback:\n\n```typescript\ninterface FalsePositiveFeedback {\n  id: string;\n  blockedContent: string;      // The content that was blocked\n  blockReason: string;         // Which rule triggered the block\n  packId: string;              // Which pack contained the rule\n  submittedBy: string;\n  submittedAt: Date;\n  status: 'pending' | 'reviewed' | 'accepted' | 'rejected';\n  reviewedBy?: string;\n  reviewedAt?: Date;\n  resolution?: 'allowlisted' | 'rule-modified' | 'no-action';\n  notes?: string;\n}\n\ninterface FeedbackWorkflow {\n  submitFeedback(feedback: CreateFeedback): Promise<FalsePositiveFeedback>;\n  reviewFeedback(id: string, decision: FeedbackDecision): Promise<FalsePositiveFeedback>;\n  getPendingFeedback(): Promise<FalsePositiveFeedback[]>;\n  getFeedbackStats(): Promise<FeedbackStats>;\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Pack Enable/Disable Configuration\n\nDCG rules are organized into packs that can be individually enabled or disabled:\n\n```typescript\ninterface DCGPack {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  version: string;\n  ruleCount: number;\n  enabled: boolean;\n  priority: number;          // Higher priority packs evaluated first\n  scope: 'system' | 'organization' | 'repository';\n}\n\ninterface PackConfiguration {\n  enablePack(packId: string): Promise<void>;\n  disablePack(packId: string): Promise<void>;\n  setPriority(packId: string, priority: number): Promise<void>;\n  getPackStatus(): Promise<DCGPack[]>;\n  reloadPacks(): Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Block Statistics Dashboard\n\nReal-time visibility into DCG activity:\n\n```typescript\ninterface BlockStatistics {\n  totalBlocks: number;\n  blocksToday: number;\n  blocksByPack: Record<string, number>;\n  blocksByRule: Record<string, number>;\n  blocksByAgent: Record<string, number>;\n  blocksByHour: TimeSeriesData;\n  topBlockedPatterns: PatternStat[];\n  falsePositiveRate: number;\n}\n\ninterface StatisticsService {\n  getStatistics(timeRange: TimeRange): Promise<BlockStatistics>;\n  getBlockHistory(filters: BlockFilters): Promise<BlockEvent[]>;\n  exportStatistics(format: 'csv' | 'json'): Promise<string>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. CM Integration for Pattern Learning\n\nIntegration with Claude Mind enables the safety system to learn from patterns:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CMPatternLearning {\n  // Report patterns to CM for analysis\n  reportPattern(pattern: PatternReport): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Request pattern classification from CM\n  classifyContent(content: string): Promise<ContentClassification>;\n  \n  // Get suggested rules from CM analysis\n  getSuggestedRules(): Promise<SuggestedRule[]>;\n  \n  // Apply CM-suggested rule with human approval\n  applySuggestedRule(ruleId: string, approver: string): Promise<void>;\n}\n\ninterface PatternReport {\n  content: string;\n  wasBlocked: boolean;\n  wasFalsePositive: boolean;\n  context: ContentContext;\n}\n\ninterface ContentClassification {\n  category: 'safe' | 'suspicious' | 'dangerous';\n  confidence: number;\n  reasoning: string;\n  suggestedAction: 'allow' | 'block' | 'review';\n}\n```\n\n## Frontend Components\n\n### DCGDashboard.tsx\nMain dashboard showing:\n- Overall safety metrics\n- Block activity chart\n- Pack status overview\n- Quick actions\n\n### AllowlistManager.tsx\n- List of allowlist entries with search/filter\n- Add/edit/delete entry forms\n- Scope selection (global, repo, agent)\n- Usage statistics per entry\n\n### FeedbackQueue.tsx\n- Pending feedback review queue\n- Feedback detail view\n- Decision interface (accept/reject)\n- Resolution actions\n\n### PackConfigurator.tsx\n- Pack list with enable/disable toggles\n- Priority ordering (drag-and-drop)\n- Pack details and rule preview\n- Reload functionality\n\n### BlockStatisticsChart.tsx\n- Time series visualization of blocks\n- Breakdown by pack, rule, agent\n- Trend analysis\n- Export controls\n\n## File Locations\n\n- `apps/gateway/src/dcg/allowlist.service.ts` -

Update wrapError utility\nAlready planned in response wrapper task, but ensure it:\n- Looks up AI hints by error code\n- Includes severity, hint, alternative fields\n\n### 2. Update route error handlers\nEach route's handleError function needs to use wrapError:\n- `agents.ts`: handleAgentError\n- `reservations.ts`: handleError\n- `conflicts.ts`: (inline error handling)\n- `checkpoints.ts`: handleError\n- `dcg.ts`: handleError\n- `mail.ts`: handleError, respondWithGatewayError\n- `utilities.ts`: handleError\n- `beads.ts`: (check implementation)\n- `alerts.ts`: (check implementation)\n\n### 3. Update WebSocket error messages\n`ws/handlers.ts` error responses should also include hints:\n```typescript\nconst errorMsg: ServerMessage = {\n  type: \"error\",\n  code: \"FORBIDDEN\",\n  message: `Subscription denied: ${authResult.reason}`,\n  severity: \"terminal\",\n  hint: AI_HINTS.WS_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED.suggestedAction,\n};\n```\n\n### 4. Ensure all error codes have hints\nReview `ai-hints.ts` to ensure coverage for:\n- All codes in `error-codes.ts`\n- WebSocket-specific error codes\n- Validation error codes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] wrapError includes hints for known error codes\n- [ ] All route error handlers use wrapError\n- [ ] WebSocket errors include hints\n- [ ] All error codes have corresponding hints\n- [ ] Tests verify hints are included\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n\n## Testing\n```typescript\ndescribe(\"error responses\", () => {\n  it(\"includes AI hints for known error codes\", async () => {\n    const res = await app.request(\"/agents/nonexistent\");\n    const body = await res.json();\n    \n    expect(body.error.severity).toBe(\"terminal\");\n    expect(body.error.hint).toContain(\"List active agents\");\n  });\n  \n  it(\"works without hints for unknown codes\", async () => {\n    // Custom error code should still work\n    const res = await triggerUnknownError();\n    const body = await res.json();\n    \n    expect(body.error.code).toBeDefined();\n    expect(body.error.severity).toBeUndefined(); // OK, not required\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on: Create response wrapper utility functions (flywheel_gateway-3ib)\n- Depends on: Define canonical response envelope types (flywheel_gateway-amj)\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `packages/shared/src/api/response-utils.ts`\n- `packages/shared/src/errors/ai-hints.ts` (add missing hints)\n- All route files with error handlers\n- `apps/gateway/src/ws/handlers.ts`\n- `apps/gateway/src/ws/messages.ts` (ErrorMessage type)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T15:07:29.580213046Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T17:58:24.240876547Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T17:58:24.240876547Z","close_reason":"Implemented AI hints integration for WebSocket errors","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-brp","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-3ib","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:15Z","created_by":"import"},{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-brp","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-amj","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:15Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-c6q","title":"FEAT: Real-Time Agent Collaboration Graph","description":"## Overview\n\nInteractive visualization showing agent coordination in real-time. The Collaboration Graph provides a dynamic, force-directed graph view of all active agents, their resource reservations, and inter-agent communication patterns within a session.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nAs multi-agent systems grow in complexity, understanding coordination dynamics becomes critical. Operators frequently ask:\n\n- **\"Why is this agent waiting?\"** - Visualize blocking dependencies and resource contention\n- **\"Who has file X?\"** - Instantly see reservation ownership across the agent pool\n- **\"What's the communication flow?\"** - Trace message paths and handoff sequences\n- **\"Where are the bottlenecks?\"** - Identify coordination hotspots and deadlock risks\n\nWithout visibility into agent coordination, debugging multi-agent workflows becomes guesswork. The Collaboration Graph transforms abstract coordination state into intuitive visual patterns.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Graph Data Model\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentNode {\n  id: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  status: 'active' | 'idle' | 'waiting' | 'blocked';\n  currentTask?: string;\n  reservationCount: number;\n  messagesSent: number;\n  messagesReceived: number;\n}\n\ninterface ReservationNode {\n  id: string;\n  resourcePath: string;\n  resourceType: 'file' | 'directory' | 'lock';\n  holderId: string;\n  waiters: string[];\n  acquiredAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface ConflictNode {\n  id: string;\n  conflictType: 'deadlock' | 'contention' | 'timeout';\n  involvedAgents: string[];\n  involvedResources: string[];\n  severity: 'warning' | 'critical';\n  detectedAt: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Edge Types\n\n| Edge Type | Description | Visual Style |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------|\n| `message` | Agent-to-agent communication | Animated dashed line, directional arrow |\n| `handoff` | Task delegation between agents | Thick solid line, pulse animation |\n| `dependency` | Blocking relationship (waiting for resource) | Red dotted line when blocked |\n| `reservation` | Agent owns resource | Green solid line to reservation node |\n| `waiting` | Agent waiting for resource | Orange dashed line to reservation node |\n\n### Real-Time Updates\n\n```typescript\n// WebSocket subscription for graph updates\nconst subscriptions = {\n  'agent.status': updateAgentNode,\n  'reservation.acquired': addReservationEdge,\n  'reservation.released': removeReservationEdge,\n  'message.sent': animateMessageEdge,\n  'conflict.detected': highlightConflictNode,\n  'conflict.resolved': removeConflictNode,\n};\n```\n\nUpdates are batched at 100ms intervals to prevent UI thrashing during high-activity periods.\n\n### View Modes\n\n| Mode | Shows | Use Case |\n|------|-------|----------|\n| **Agents Only** | Agent nodes + message/handoff edges | Communication flow analysis |\n| **Files** | Agent nodes + reservation nodes + ownership edges | Resource contention debugging |\n| **Full** | All nodes + all edges | Complete system state |\n\n### Layout Algorithm\n\n- **Base**: Force-directed layout using D3-force\n- **Clustering**: Semantic grouping by active task similarity\n- **Collision**: Node repulsion prevents overlap\n- **Centering**: Active/blocked agents pulled toward center\n- **Stabilization**: Layout settles within 500ms of changes\n\n## Key Components\n\n```\napps/web/src/components/collaboration/\n├── CollaborationGraph.tsx       # Main container, manages state & subscriptions\n├── nodes/\n│   ├── AgentGraphNode.tsx       # Agent visualization with status indicators\n│   ├── ReservationGraphNode.tsx # Resource node with holder/waiter counts\n│   └── ConflictGraphNode.tsx    # Conflict alert with severity styling\n├── edges/\n│   ├── MessageEdge.tsx          # Animated message flow visualization\n│   ├── HandoffEdge.tsx          # Task delegation indicator\n│   └── DependencyEdge.tsx       # Blocking relationship with state color\n├── controls/\n│   ├── ViewModeSelector.tsx     # Toggle between view modes\n│   ├── GraphLegend.tsx          # Visual key for node/edge types\n│   └── GraphStats.tsx           # Real-time metrics panel\n├── hooks/\n│   ├── useGraphSubscription.ts  # WebSocket subscription management\n│   ├── useGraphLayout.ts        # D3-force layout integration\n│   └── useGraphSelection.ts     # Node/edge selection state\n└── utils/\n    ├── graphTransforms.ts       # API data to React Flow format\n    └── layoutConfig.ts          # D3-force parameters\n```\n\n## Technology\n\n- **React Flow** (`@xyflow/react`) -

Event Type Definitions\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/ru-events.ts\n\n// Fleet Events\nexport interface RURepoAddedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.repo_added\";\n  data: {\n    repoId: string;\n    fullName: string;\n    owner: string;\n    name: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RURepoRemovedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.repo_removed\";\n  data: {\n    repoId: string;\n    fullName: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RURepoStatusChangedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.repo_status_changed\";\n  data: {\n    repoId: string;\n    fullName: string;\n    status: RepoStatus;\n    previousStatus?: RepoStatus;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\n// Sync Events\nexport interface RUSyncStartedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sync_started\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    repoCount: number;\n    triggeredBy: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSyncRepoStartedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sync_repo_started\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    repoId: string;\n    fullName: string;\n    operation: \"clone\" | \"pull\";\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSyncRepoCompletedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sync_repo_completed\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    repoId: string;\n    fullName: string;\n    success: boolean;\n    duration: number;\n    error?: string;\n    commitCount?: number;\n    completed: number;\n    failed: number;\n    total: number;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSyncCompletedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sync_completed\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    completed: number;\n    failed: number;\n    total: number;\n    totalDuration: number;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSyncCancelledEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sync_cancelled\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    cancelledBy?: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\n// Sweep Events\nexport interface RUSweepCreatedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_created\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    repoCount: number;\n    triggeredBy: string;\n    requiresApproval: boolean;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepStartedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_started\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepProgressEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_progress\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    phase: \"phase1\" | \"phase2\" | \"phase3\";\n    current: string;  // Current repo being processed\n    progress: {\n      analyzed?: number;\n      planned?: number;\n      executed?: number;\n      failed?: number;\n      total: number;\n    };\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepPhaseCompletedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_phase_completed\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    phase: \"phase1\" | \"phase2\" | \"phase3\";\n    duration: number;\n    results: {\n      processed: number;\n      failed: number;\n    };\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepPlanCreatedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_plan_created\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    planId: string;\n    repoFullName: string;\n    actionCount: number;\n    riskLevel: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepPlanApprovedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_plan_approved\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    planId: string;\n    repoFullName: string;\n    approvedBy: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepPlanRejectedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_plan_rejected\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    planId: string;\n    repoFullName: string;\n    rejectedBy: string;\n    reason: string;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\nexport interface RUSweepCompletedEvent {\n  type: \"ru.sweep_completed\";\n  data: {\n    sessionId: string;\n    status: \"completed\" | \"failed\" | \"cancelled\";\n    summary: {\n      analyzed: number;\n      planned: number;\n      approved: number;\n      executed: number;\n      failed: number;\n      skipped: number;\n    };\n    totalDuration: number;\n  };\n  timestamp: string;\n}\n\n// Union type for all RU events\nexport type RUEvent =\n  | RURepoAddedEvent\n  | RURepoRemovedEvent\n  | RURepoStatusChangedEvent\n  | RUSyncStartedEvent\n  | RUSyncRepoStartedEvent\n  | RUSyncRepoCompletedEvent\n  | RUSyncCompletedEvent\n  | RUSyncCancelledEvent\n  | RUSweepCreatedEvent\n  | RUSweepStartedEvent\n  | RUSweepProgressEvent\n  | RUSweepPhaseCompletedEvent\n  | RUSweepPlanCreatedEvent\n  | RUSweepPlanApprovedEvent\n  | RUSweepPlanRejectedEvent\n  | RUSweepCompletedEvent;\n```\n\n### 2.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-cex","title":"[Epic] DELETE Endpoint Body Refactor","description":"# Epic: DELETE Endpoint Body Refactor\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nSeveral DELETE endpoints require a request body, which is unconventional for REST APIs and causes issues with some HTTP clients and proxies.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**DELETE with body (reservations.ts:453-462):**\n```typescript\nreservations.delete(\"/:id\", async (c) => {\n  const id = c.req.param(\"id\");\n  const body = await c.req.json();  // ← Requires body!\n  const validated = ReleaseReservationSchema.parse(body);\n  // Uses validated.agentId for authorization\n```\n\nThe body contains:\n```json\n{\n  \"agentId\": \"agent-123\"  // Used to verify ownership\n}\n```\n\n### Why DELETE with Body is Problematic\n\n1. **HTTP Spec Ambiguity**: RFC 7231 says DELETE body has no defined semantics\n2. **Client Support**: Some HTTP clients don't support DELETE body\n   - Fetch API: Works but non-intuitive\n   - curl: Works but requires explicit flags\n   - Some proxies: May strip the body\n3. **Caching Issues**: Proxies may cache DELETE without considering body\n4. **Developer Confusion**: Unexpected for REST conventions\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\n**Option A: Query Parameter**\n```\nDELETE /reservations/:id?agentId=agent-123\n```\nPros: Simple, widely supported\nCons: Less secure (visible in logs, URLs)\n\n**Option B: Custom Header**\n```\nDELETE /reservations/:id\nX-Agent-Id: agent-123\n```\nPros: Clean URL, secure\nCons: Non-standard header\n\n**Option C: Resource Path**\n```\nDELETE /reservations/:id/agent/:agentId\n```\nPros: RESTful\nCons: Verbose URL\n\n**Option D: Implicit from Auth Context**\n```\nDELETE /reservations/:id\nAuthorization: Bearer <token-with-agentId>\n```\nPros: No extra params needed\nCons: Requires auth to always carry agentId\n\n### Recommended Approach\nUse **Option B (Custom Header)** for authorization context:\n```\nDELETE /reservations/:id\nX-Agent-Id: agent-123\n```\n\nThis is clean, secure, and follows patterns used by other APIs (e.g., `X-Request-Id`).\n\n## Goals\n1. **Standards Compliance**: DELETE endpoints don't require body\n2. **Client Compatibility**: Works with all HTTP clients\n3. **Security**: Authorization data not in URL\n4. **Clarity**: Obvious how to make the request\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All DELETE endpoints work without body\n- [ ] Authorization passed via header or auth context\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n- [ ] Tests updated\n- [ ] Migration guide for existing clients\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Identify all DELETE endpoints with body\n2. Choose parameter passing strategy (header)\n3. Update route handlers\n4. Update validation schemas\n5. Update tests\n6. Document breaking change\n\n## Affected Endpoints\n- `DELETE /reservations/:id` - requires agentId in body\n- Audit other DELETE endpoints for similar issues\n\n## Dependencies\n- None directly, but should coordinate with HTTP Status Epic\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Breaking Change**: Clients sending body will fail\n  - Mitigation: Accept both body and header temporarily\n  - Mitigation: Version the API or deprecation period\n- **Security**: Header value in logs\n  - Mitigation: Ensure logging redacts sensitive headers","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T15:00:28.154237252Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:42:46.845474954Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:42:46.845474954Z","close_reason":"Already implemented: DELETE /reservations/:id now supports X-Agent-Id header (preferred) with body fallback and deprecation warning.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-d18","title":"FEAT: Structured Logging + Correlation IDs + Audit Pipeline","description":"## Background\n\nObservability is foundational for operating a production agent orchestration system. Without structured logging and correlation IDs, debugging distributed request flows becomes nearly impossible. The audit pipeline provides compliance capabilities and operational insights.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n### Why Structured JSON Logging?\n- **Machine Parseable**: JSON logs can be ingested by log aggregation systems (ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch)\n- **Consistent Schema**: All log entries follow a predictable format with timestamp, level, service, message, and metadata\n- **Queryable**: Enables powerful filtering and analysis across all system components\n- **Production Ready**: Essential for SRE workflows and incident response\n\n### Why Correlation IDs?\n- **Request Tracing**: Track a single user request through gateway, agent service, and all downstream components\n- **Debugging**: When something fails, find all related log entries instantly\n- **Performance Analysis**: Measure latency across the full request lifecycle\n- **multi-workspace Safety**: Ensure logs can be filtered per-workspace for support inquiries\n\n### Why Audit Pipeline?\n- **Compliance**: Many advanced customers require audit trails for agent actions\n- **Security**: Detect and investigate suspicious activity patterns\n- **Analytics**: Understand system usage patterns and optimize accordingly\n- **Accountability**: Track which user/API key triggered which agent operations\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Logging Implementation\n- Use `pino` for high-performance JSON logging (10x faster than winston)\n- Configure log levels: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal\n- Default to `info` in production, `debug` in development\n- Implement log rotation and size limits for local development\n- Redact sensitive fields: API keys, tokens, passwords, PII\n\n### Correlation ID Strategy\n- Generate UUID v7 (time-ordered) for new requests at gateway entry\n- Accept incoming `X-Correlation-ID` header to support distributed tracing\n- Propagate via AsyncLocalStorage for automatic inclusion in all logs\n- Include in all HTTP responses for client-side correlation\n- Pass to spawned agents via environment variable\n\n### Audit Event Schema\n```typescript\ninterface AuditEvent {\n  id: string;                    // UUID v7\n  timestamp: string;             // ISO 8601\n  correlationId: string;         // Request correlation\n  workspaceId: string;              // multi-workspace isolation\n  userId?: string;               // Authenticated user\n  apiKeyId?: string;             // API key used\n  action: AuditAction;           // Enum of auditable actions\n  resource: string;              // Resource identifier\n  resourceType: ResourceType;    // agent, session, output, etc.\n  outcome: 'success' | 'failure';\n  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;\n  ipAddress?: string;            // For security analysis\n  userAgent?: string;            // Client identification\n}\n```\n\n### Sensitive Data Redaction\n- API keys: Show only last 4 characters\n- Passwords: Replace entirely with `[REDACTED]`\n- Email addresses: Partial redaction `j***@example.com`\n- Custom redaction rules via configuration\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All HTTP requests receive correlation ID (generated or propagated)\n- [ ] All log entries include: timestamp, level, correlationId, service, message\n- [ ] Sensitive fields are automatically redacted in logs\n- [ ] Log level is configurable via environment variable\n- [ ] Audit events are emitted for: agent spawn, agent terminate, session create, authentication\n- [ ] Audit events are written to both log stream and audit table\n- [ ] Correlation ID appears in HTTP response headers\n- [ ] AsyncLocalStorage correctly propagates context through async operations\n- [ ] Unit tests for redaction logic with edge cases\n- [ ] Integration test for correlation ID propagation\n\n## File Locations\n\n### Middleware\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/correlation.middleware.ts` - Correlation ID generation/propagation\n- `apps/gateway/src/middleware/logging.middleware.ts` - Request/response logging\n\n### Services\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/audit.service.ts` - Audit event creation and persistence\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/logger.service.ts` - Configured pino logger instance\n\n### Utilities\n- `apps/gateway/src/utils/redaction.ts` - Sensitive data redaction functions\n- `apps/gateway/src/utils/async-context.ts` - AsyncLocalStorage helpers\n\n### Configuration\n- `apps/gateway/src/config/logging.config.ts` - Log levels, formats, destinations\n\n### Types\n- `packages/shared-types/src/audit.types.ts` - Audit event interfaces and enums\n\n## Reference\n\n- PLAN.md §24: Observability and Logging\n- OpenTelemetry Logging Data Model for schema inspiration\n- OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet for security considerations\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Correlation ID generation/propagation across middleware, services, and WS events\n- [ ] Redaction utilities remove secrets deterministically\n- [ ] Audit event builder produces schema-valid events with required metadata\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] REST request with correlation header → response + logs include same correlationId\n- [ ] WS event emission includes correlationId and matches event schema\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Logging backend unavailable → non-fatal fallback without dropping requests\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite;

When missing, the system must degrade gracefully with actionable guidance.\n\n## Utility Management (PLAN.md §17.7.1)\n\n### Data Model\n\n```ts\n// packages/shared/src/types/utilities.ts\n\nexport interface DeveloperUtility {\n  name: string;           // \"giil\" | \"csctf\"\n  description: string;\n  version: string;        // desired/known-good\n  installCommand: string; // one-liner install\n  checkCommand: string;   // verify installation\n  installed: boolean;\n  installedVersion?: string;\n  lastCheckedAt?: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### Known Utilities\n\n```ts\nconst UTILITIES: DeveloperUtility[] = [\n  {\n    name: 'giil',\n    description: 'Download cloud photos for AI visual analysis',\n    version: '3.1.0',\n    installCommand: 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/giil/main/install.sh | bash',\n    checkCommand: 'giil --version',\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'csctf',\n    description: 'Convert AI chat share links to Markdown/HTML',\n    version: '0.4.5',\n    installCommand: 'curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dicklesworthstone/chat_shared_conversation_to_file/main/install.sh | bash',\n    checkCommand: 'csctf --version',\n  },\n];\n```\n\n## REST API Endpoints (PLAN.md §17.7.2)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/utilities` | List all utilities with install status |\n| `POST` | `/utilities/{name}/install` | Install a utility |\n| `POST` | `/utilities/{name}/update` | Update a utility |\n| `GET` | `/utilities/doctor` | Check all utilities health |\n\n## giil Integration (PLAN.md §17.7.3)\n\ngiil enables agents (and humans) to pull screenshots/images from cloud share links into a local artifact that can be attached to agent context or used for debugging UI.\n\n```ts\ninterface GiilRequest {\n  url: string; // iCloud/Dropbox/Google share URL\n  outputDir?: string;\n  format?: 'file' | 'json' | 'base64';\n}\n\ninterface GiilResponse {\n  success: boolean;\n  path?: string;\n  width?: number;\n  height?: number;\n  captureMethod?: 'download' | 'cdn' | 'element' | 'viewport';\n  error?: string;\n}\n```\n\n## csctf Integration (PLAN.md §17.7.4)\n\ncsctf enables archiving AI conversations for knowledge management, documentation, and downstream indexing into CASS.\n\n```ts\ninterface CsctfRequest {\n  url: string; // ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok/Claude share URL\n  outputDir?: string;\n  formats?: ('md' | 'html')[];\n  publishToGhPages?: boolean;\n}\n\ninterface CsctfResponse {\n  success: boolean;\n  markdownPath?: string;\n  htmlPath?: string;\n  title?: string;\n  messageCount?: number;\n  error?: string;\n}\n```\n\n## UX Requirements\n\n- Utilities page shows installed/missing status, version, and a single “Doctor” button.\n- Missing utilities show copy-paste install command (and optional one-click install if configured).\n- Running giil/csctf from the UI shows progress, captures stdout/stderr, and stores a small artifact summary.\n\n## Safety / Security Requirements\n\n- Never log full share URLs or OAuth tokens. Prefer logging `urlHost` + `urlHash`.\n- Validate `outputDir` (must be within an allowlisted base dir; reject traversal).\n- Rate-limit install/update and run endpoints.\n- Treat all subprocess execution as untrusted: set timeouts, capture output with size limits.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `/utilities` returns both utilities with deterministic install status and versions.\n- [ ] `/utilities/doctor` checks both utilities and returns structured health results.\n- [ ] Install/update endpoints run the defined install commands with bounded logs and clear failure reasons.\n- [ ] giil/csctf integrations return structured responses and store artifacts safely.\n- [ ] Missing utilities produce actionable, copy-paste guidance; UI does not crash.\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Utility detection: PATH lookup + version parsing is deterministic\n- [ ] OutputDir validation rejects traversal and disallowed roots\n- [ ] Subprocess wrapper enforces timeouts and log-size bounds\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] When utilities are missing: endpoints report unavailable and UI shows actionable install guidance\n- [ ] When utilities are present (mocked): run a no-op invocation and capture structured results\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Non-zero exit / timeout / malformed output → mapped error taxonomy and safe logs\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] UI: user visits Utilities page, runs Doctor, and sees install guidance\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Logs include correlationId + utility + version + attemptId; never log share URLs or tokens\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-08T18:32:15.061618044Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-10T03:30:53.560913175Z","closed_at":"2026-01-10T03:30:53.560913175Z","close_reason":"Developer Utilities feature complete: utilities.service.ts with giil/csctf integration, REST endpoints, security validation, 15 passing tests","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-dje","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:15Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-dkz","title":"[Epic] Rate Limit Headers","description":"# Epic: Rate Limit Headers\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nThe API has rate limiting capabilities but doesn't communicate rate limit status to clients via standard HTTP headers. Clients can't proactively manage their request rate.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n- Rate limiting exists (RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED error code in taxonomy)\n- No rate limit headers returned in responses\n- Clients only learn about limits when they hit them\n- No way to see remaining quota\n\n### Industry Standard (Stripe/GitHub)\nRate limit headers in every response:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 100\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 99\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000\n```\n\nOn rate limit exceeded:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nX-RateLimit-Limit: 100\nX-RateLimit-Remaining: 0\nX-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000060\nRetry-After: 60\n```\n\n### Why This Matters\n1. **Proactive Throttling**: Clients can slow down before hitting limits\n2. **Efficient Scheduling**: Batch operations when quota available\n3. **Debugging**: Understand why requests failed\n4. **Multi-Client Coordination**: Shared quota visibility\n\n## Goals\n1. **Visibility**: Every response includes rate limit headers\n2. **Predictability**: Clients know when limits reset\n3. **Graceful Handling**: 429 includes Retry-After\n4. **Granularity**: Per-endpoint or per-resource limits visible\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Rate limit tracking middleware created\n- [ ] All responses include rate limit headers\n- [ ] 429 responses include Retry-After\n- [ ] Rate limits configurable per endpoint\n- [ ] Tests verify header presence\n- [ ] Documentation explains rate limits\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Create rate limit tracking middleware\n2. Store request counts (in-memory or Redis)\n3. Add headers via Hono middleware\n4. Configure limits per endpoint/resource\n5. Return 429 with proper headers when exceeded\n\n## Header Definitions\n- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in window\n- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining in window\n- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when window resets\n- `Retry-After`: Seconds until retry allowed (on 429)\n\n## Rate Limit Strategies\n1. **Per-IP**: Simple but problematic with shared IPs\n2. **Per-API-Key**: Standard for authenticated APIs\n3. **Per-User**: Based on authenticated user\n4. **Per-Resource**: Limits on specific resources (agent creation)\n\n## Window Types\n- **Fixed Window**: Reset at fixed intervals (simple but bursty)\n- **Sliding Window**: Rolling window (smoother but complex)\n- **Token Bucket**: Burst-friendly with sustained limit\n\n## Dependencies\n- None directly, can be done independently\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Performance**: Tracking requests adds overhead\n  - Mitigation: Use efficient in-memory counter with atomic ops\n- **Distributed**: Multiple instances need shared state\n  - Mitigation: Redis for distributed rate limiting\n- **Clock Skew**: Reset times may vary\n  - Mitigation: Use relative Retry-After in addition to Reset","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T15:01:33.181796193Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-13T00:31:00.044247275Z","closed_at":"2026-01-13T00:31:00.044247275Z","close_reason":"Already implemented: apps/gateway/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts has full X-RateLimit-* and Retry-After header support.

It leverages tmux for PTY management and session isolation.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nWhile native agent drivers (Claude Code SDK, API-based) offer superior integration, some scenarios require terminal-based execution:\n\n- Legacy agent tools without API support\n- Debugging and development workflows\n- Environments where native drivers fail\n- Manual intervention capabilities\n\nTmux provides robust session management with:\n- Detached execution (survives driver disconnect)\n- Full PTY support (handles interactive prompts)\n- Session capture (complete output history)\n- Scriptable control interface\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### AgentDriver Interface Compliance\n\nThe Tmux driver implements the standard AgentDriver interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  type: 'native' | 'api' | 'terminal';\n  \n  initialize(config: DriverConfig): Promise<void>;\n  start(agent: Agent, task: Task): Promise<AgentSession>;\n  stop(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;\n  sendInput(sessionId: string, input: string): Promise<void>;\n  getOutput(sessionId: string): Promise<OutputChunk[]>;\n  getStatus(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionStatus>;\n  cleanup(): Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n### TmuxAgentDriver Implementation\n\n```typescript\nclass TmuxAgentDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly id = 'tmux-driver';\n  readonly name = 'Tmux Terminal Driver';\n  readonly type = 'terminal';\n  \n  private sessions: Map<string, TmuxSession> = new Map();\n  private tmuxSocketPath: string;\n  \n  async initialize(config: TmuxDriverConfig): Promise<void> {\n    // Verify tmux installation\n    // Create dedicated socket for isolation\n    // Set up output capture directory\n  }\n  \n  async start(agent: Agent, task: Task): Promise<AgentSession> {\n    // Create new tmux session with unique name\n    // Configure PTY dimensions\n    // Start agent command\n    // Begin output capture\n    // Return session handle\n  }\n  \n  async stop(sessionId: string): Promise<void> {\n    // Send SIGTERM to session\n    // Wait for graceful shutdown\n    // Force kill if timeout\n    // Clean up session resources\n  }\n  \n  async sendInput(sessionId: string, input: string): Promise<void> {\n    // Send keys to tmux session\n    // Handle special characters\n    // Support escape sequences\n  }\n  \n  async getOutput(sessionId: string): Promise<OutputChunk[]> {\n    // Capture pane contents\n    // Parse into structured chunks\n    // Track output position\n    // Handle ANSI codes\n  }\n  \n  async getStatus(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionStatus> {\n    // Check if session exists\n    // Get running process info\n    // Calculate resource usage\n    // Return structured status\n  }\n  \n  async cleanup(): Promise<void> {\n    // Kill all managed sessions\n    // Remove socket file\n    // Clean up capture directory\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### PTY Management\n\n```typescript\ninterface TmuxSession {\n  sessionName: string;\n  windowId: string;\n  paneId: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  lastActivity: Date;\n  outputFile: string;\n  outputPosition: number;\n  pid?: number;\n}\n\ninterface TmuxManager {\n  // Session lifecycle\n  createSession(name: string, command: string): Promise<TmuxSession>;\n  destroySession(name: string): Promise<void>;\n  listSessions(): Promise<TmuxSession[]>;\n  \n  // Input/Output\n  sendKeys(session: string, keys: string): Promise<void>;\n  capturePane(session: string, options: CaptureOptions): Promise<string>;\n  \n  // Session management\n  hasSession(name: string): Promise<boolean>;\n  getSessionPid(name: string): Promise<number | null>;\n  resizePane(session: string, width: number, height: number): Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n### Output Capture Strategy\n\nTwo complementary capture mechanisms:\n\n1. **Pipe Capture** (for real-time streaming)\n   ```bash\n   tmux pipe-pane -t $SESSION -o \"cat >> /path/to/output.log\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Pane Capture** (for complete history)\n   ```bash\n   tmux capture-pane -t $SESSION -p -S -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-ew1","title":"Auto-Healing Context Window Management","description":"## Background\n\nAuto-Healing Context Window Management is a proactive system that monitors context window health and takes corrective action before problems occur. Rather than waiting for context overflow errors, this system maintains optimal context health through graduated interventions.\n\n### Why This Matters\n\n1. **Proactive vs Reactive**: Waiting for context overflow means lost work and degraded agent performance. Proactive management prevents these issues entirely.\n\n2. **Seamless Experience**: Users and agents should never experience sudden context loss. Graduated interventions maintain continuity.\n\n3. **Cost Optimization**: Compaction and summarization reduce token usage while preserving essential information.\n\n4. **Agent Continuity**: When rotation is necessary, automatic context transfer ensures the new agent starts with full awareness.\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Health Thresholds\n\n```typescript\ninterface ContextHealthThresholds {\n  // Warning level - start preparing\n  warning: {\n    percentage: 75;

 // Minimum time between alerts\n  actions?: AlertAction[];\n}\n```\n\n### Default Alert Rules\n\n- **agent_stalled**: Agent no output for 5+ minutes → warning\n- **quota_warning**: Account at 80%+ quota → warning\n- **quota_exceeded**: Account at 100% quota → error\n- **daemon_failed**: Daemon process failed → critical\n- **conflict_detected**: File conflict requires resolution → info\n- **security_violation**: Safety rule triggered → error\n\n### REST API Endpoints\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/metrics` | Current metrics snapshot |\n| `GET` | `/metrics/history` | Historical metrics |\n| `GET` | `/metrics/compare` | Compare time periods |\n| `POST` | `/metrics/snapshot` | Create named snapshot |\n| `GET` | `/metrics/snapshots` | List snapshots |\n| `POST` | `/metrics/export` | Export metrics data |\n| `GET` | `/alerts` | List active alerts |\n| `GET` | `/alerts/history` | Alert history |\n| `POST` | `/alerts/{id}/acknowledge` | Acknowledge alert |\n| `POST` | `/alerts/{id}/dismiss` | Dismiss alert |\n| `POST` | `/alerts/{id}/action` | Execute alert action |\n| `GET` | `/alerts/rules` | List alert rules |\n| `PUT` | `/alerts/rules` | Update alert rules |\n| `GET` | `/health/prometheus` | Prometheus metrics endpoint |\n\n### OpenTelemetry Integration\n\n```typescript\n// Metric types\nconst agentCounter = meter.createCounter('flywheel.agents.spawned');\nconst tokenHistogram = meter.createHistogram('flywheel.tokens.used');\nconst latencyHistogram = meter.createHistogram('flywheel.api.latency');\nconst activeGauge = meter.createObservableGauge('flywheel.agents.active');\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n| Component | Path |\n|-----------|------|\n| Metrics Service | `apps/gateway/src/services/metrics.service.ts` |\n| Alert Service | `apps/gateway/src/services/alert.service.ts` |\n| Alert Rules | `apps/gateway/src/services/alert-rules.ts` |\n| Metrics Routes | `apps/gateway/src/routes/metrics.routes.ts` |\n| Alert Routes | `apps/gateway/src/routes/alerts.routes.ts` |\n| Prometheus Endpoint | `apps/gateway/src/routes/health.routes.ts` |\n| Metrics Dashboard UI | `apps/web/src/components/analytics/MetricsDashboard.tsx` |\n| Alert Center UI | `apps/web/src/components/analytics/AlertCenter.tsx` |\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] MetricsService.record() creates correct metric types (counter, gauge, histogram)\n- [ ] AlertRule.evaluate() returns correct state for each condition type\n- [ ] Alert deduplication works for repeated violations within cooldown\n- [ ] Histogram bucket boundaries are correctly configured\n- [ ] Trend calculation produces accurate up/down/stable values\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Metrics are persisted and queryable via REST API\n- [ ] Alert triggers create database records correctly\n- [ ] Alert acknowledgment updates state and records user\n- [ ] Metric aggregation returns correct summaries\n- [ ] Prometheus endpoint exports valid metrics format\n- [ ] OpenTelemetry spans correlate with metrics\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Grafana dashboard shows live metrics (via Prometheus)\n- [ ] Dashboard refreshes in real-time via WebSocket\n- [ ] Alert visible in UI with correct severity styling\n- [ ] Alert can be acknowledged with optional comment\n- [ ] Historical metrics queryable and graphable\n\n### Load Tests\n- [ ] System handles 10,000 metric points/second\n- [ ] P95 metric recording latency < 1ms\n- [ ] Alert evaluation completes within 100ms for 1000 rules\n- [ ] Prometheus scrape endpoint returns within 500ms\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Metric recording continues if database is slow (buffered)\n- [ ] Alerts fire even if notification delivery fails (logged)\n- [ ] Invalid metric name produces validation error\n- [ ] Alert loop is debounced by cooldown mechanism\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Metrics/alerts tests log `metricName`, label set, thresholds, and `alertId` with correlation IDs\n- [ ] Notification triggers in tests log routing decisions without exposing secrets\n\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\n### Metric Recording\n```typescript\nlogger.debug('metrics:recorded', {\n  correlationId,\n  metricName,\n  value,\n  labels,\n  timestamp\n});\n```\n\n### Alert Firing\n```typescript\nlogger.info('alert:fired', {\n  correlationId,\n  alertId,\n  type,\n  severity,\n  source,\n  message\n});\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Metrics model + storage implemented for core dimensions (agents, jobs, WS, scans, reservations)\n- [ ] Alert rules can be created/updated/disabled and evaluate deterministically (with debounce/cooldowns)\n- [ ] REST endpoints return consistent envelopes + correlation IDs;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-i6c","title":"Custom Dashboard Builder","description":"## Background\n\nAs the Flywheel Gateway platform matures, users need the ability to create personalized views of their agent ecosystem, costs, and activity metrics. A custom dashboard builder enables users to construct tailored monitoring interfaces without requiring engineering intervention, democratizing data visualization across the organization.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently, users are limited to predefined dashboard layouts that may not align with their specific monitoring needs. Different roles (developers, managers, finance) have distinct requirements for data visualization. Without customization capabilities, users either lack visibility into relevant metrics or must request engineering resources for custom reports.\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Core Architecture\n\nThe dashboard builder will leverage react-grid-layout for drag-and-drop widget placement, providing a familiar interface similar to tools like Grafana or Datadog dashboards.\n\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/components/analytics/DashboardBuilder.tsx\ninterface Dashboard {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description?: string;\n  ownerId: string;\n  visibility: 'private' | 'team' | 'public';\n  teamId?: string;\n  layout: DashboardLayout;\n  widgets: Widget[];\n  refreshInterval: number;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-kue","title":"TASK: Risk Mitigations and Resilience","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead tracks the mitigation strategies for the 16+ risks identified in PLAN.md §26 (Risk Register). While many mitigations are implemented by specific feature beads, this bead ensures all risks have explicit mitigation coverage and testing.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\n### Why This Bead Exists\nRisk management requires visibility. Individual features implement mitigations, but without central tracking we can't verify:\n1. All risks have assigned mitigations\n2. Mitigations are actually tested\n3. Residual risk is acceptable\n\n### Risk Matrix\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Primary Mitigation Bead |\n|------|------------|--------|-------------------------|\n| Agent runaway | Medium | High | flywheel_gateway-398 (Lifecycle) |\n| Account quota exhaustion | High | High | flywheel_gateway-41h (CAAM) |\n| File conflicts | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-5nm + flywheel_gateway-3b1 |\n| Context overflow | High | Medium | flywheel_gateway-ew1 (Auto-Healing) |\n| Work handoff failures | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-2pl (Handoff Protocol) |\n| Checkpoint storage explosion | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-36m (Delta Checkpoints) |\n| Network interruption | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-46c (WebSocket) |\n| Daemon failure | Low | High | flywheel_gateway-76h (Supervisor) |\n| Data loss | Low | Critical | flywheel_gateway-36m + flywheel_gateway-toe |\n| Security breach | Low | Critical | flywheel_gateway-bz1 (Security) |\n| Coordination visibility | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-c6q (Collab Graph) |\n| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-mag (Performance) |\n| Provider outage | Low | High | flywheel_gateway-41h (Multi-provider) |\n| Cost overruns | Medium | High | flywheel_gateway-rgx (Cost Analytics) |\n| Notification fatigue | Medium | Low | flywheel_gateway-59c (Notifications) |\n| Agent performance blind spots | Medium | Medium | flywheel_gateway-6wp (Performance Analytics) |\n| Flywheel visibility gaps | Low | Medium | flywheel_gateway-66n (Velocity Dashboard) |\n\n## Risk Mitigation Details\n\n### 1. Agent Runaway (Medium/High)\n**Symptoms**: Agent consumes excessive tokens, runs indefinitely, or produces harmful output.\n**Mitigations**:\n- Token limits per agent session (configurable, default 100K)\n- Activity detection: no progress for N minutes triggers alert\n- Auto-interrupt after configurable timeout\n- Checkpoint before long operations\n- DCG blocks destructive commands\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Agent exceeding token limit is terminated gracefully\n- [ ] Inactive agent triggers alert after 5 minutes\n- [ ] Auto-interrupt stops runaway agent\n- [ ] Checkpoint created before risky operations\n\n### 2. Account Quota Exhaustion (High/High)\n**Symptoms**: All API keys hit rate limits, agents blocked.\n**Mitigations**:\n- CAAM pool rotation across multiple accounts\n- Per-account cooldown tracking\n- Multi-provider support (Claude + Codex + Gemini)\n- Graceful queuing when all accounts exhausted\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Rotation occurs automatically on rate limit\n- [ ] Cooldown prevents immediate retry on same account\n- [ ] Fallback to alternate provider works\n- [ ] Queue drains when account recovers\n\n### 3. File Conflicts (Medium/Medium)\n**Symptoms**: Multiple agents edit same file, causing overwrites.\n**Mitigations**:\n- Advisory file reservations with TTL\n- Conflict detection alerts\n- Intelligent Conflict Resolution Assistant suggests merges\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Reservation prevents second agent from editing\n- [ ] Conflict detected when reservation bypassed\n- [ ] AI suggestions generate reasonable merges\n- [ ] Conflict history preserved for audit\n\n### 4. Context Overflow (High/Medium)\n**Symptoms**: Agent context window fills up, loses coherence.\n**Mitigations**:\n- Auto-Healing Context Windows with graduated thresholds (75%/85%/95%)\n- Proactive summarization at warning threshold\n- Seamless agent rotation with context transfer\n- Context pack builder with token budgeting\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Warning at 75% utilization\n- [ ] Auto-summarization at 85%\n- [ ] Rotation at 95% preserves context\n- [ ] No data loss during rotation\n\n### 5. Work Handoff Failures (Medium/Medium)\n**Symptoms**: Context lost when rotating agents, work duplicated or dropped.\n**Mitigations**:\n- First-Class Session Handoff Protocol\n- Structured context transfer with acknowledgment\n- Resource handover (reservations, locks)\n- Pending work queue transfer\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Handoff preserves all context\n- [ ] Reservations transfer to new agent\n- [ ] Pending tasks not lost\n- [ ] Handoff audit trail complete\n\n### 6. Checkpoint Storage Explosion (Medium/Medium)\n**Symptoms**: Disk fills up with checkpoint data.\n**Mitigations**:\n- Delta-based progressive checkpointing (~55% reduction)\n- Automatic compaction of old chains\n- Configurable retention policies\n- Storage tiering (hot -> cold)\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Delta checkpoints are <20% of full\n- [ ] Compaction runs on schedule\n- [ ] Retention deletes old checkpoints\n- [ ] Storage alarms trigger before full\n\n### 7. Network Interruption (Medium/Medium)\n**Symptoms**: WebSocket disconnects, output lost.\n**Mitigations**:\n- Durable ring buffers preserve messages\n- Cursor-based reconnection with replay\n- Offline queue for pending messages\n- Heartbeat with auto-reconnect\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Reconnection within 5 seconds\n- [ ] No messages lost during disconnect\n- [ ] Cursor resumes from correct position\n- [ ] Offline queue drains on reconnect\n\n### 8. Daemon Failure (Low/High)\n**Symptoms**: Gateway service crashes, all agents orphaned.\n**Mitigations**:\n- Supervisor with auto-restart\n- Health checks every 30 seconds\n- Alert on repeated crashes\n- Graceful agent handover on planned shutdown\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Service restarts within 5 seconds\n- [ ] Alert after 3 crashes in 5 minutes\n- [ ] Agents survive daemon restart\n- [ ] Planned shutdown preserves state\n\n### 9. Data Loss (Low/Critical)\n**Symptoms**: Checkpoints, history, or bead data permanently lost.\n**Mitigations**:\n- WAL mode for SQLite durability\n- Delta checkpoints with redundancy\n- Git coordination backs up state\n- Regular backup verification\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Kill -9 doesn't lose data\n- [ ] Checkpoint restoration verified\n- [ ] Git contains all bead state\n- [ ] Backup restore tested quarterly\n\n### 10. Security Breach (Low/Critical)\n**Symptoms**: Unauthorized access, data exfiltration.\n**Mitigations**:\n- BYOA token isolation (workspace-local)\n- API key encryption at rest\n- Audit logging of all access\n- Safety guardrails (SLB, DCG)\n\n**Testing Requirements**:\n- [ ] Tokens never leave workspace\n- [ ] Keys encrypted in database\n- [ ] Audit captures all access\n- [ ] DCG blocks dangerous commands\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All 16 risks have assigned mitigation beads\n- [ ] Each risk has documented testing requirements\n- [ ] Mitigation effectiveness can be measured\n- [ ] Residual risk level documented\n- [ ] Runbook exists for each high-impact risk\n- [ ] Alerts configured for early warning\n- [ ] Quarterly risk review scheduled\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Risk detection logic works for each scenario\n- [ ] Mitigation triggers activate at correct thresholds\n- [ ] Fallback paths execute correctly\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] End-to-end risk scenarios exercise mitigations\n- [ ] Cross-component mitigations coordinate correctly\n- [ ] Alert pipeline delivers notifications\n\n### Chaos Tests\n- [ ] Network partition handling\n- [ ] Service crash recovery\n- [ ] Storage exhaustion handling\n- [ ] Provider outage simulation\n\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Scenario-based E2E suite (Playwright): inject representative failures (provider outage, DB down, WS reconnect) and verify UI shows actionable recovery steps.\n- [ ] Alerting E2E: when a mitigation triggers, an alert is emitted and visible in the UI notification center.\n- [ ] Artifact capture: trace/video/screenshot/console logs captured on failure and scrubbed of secrets.\n\n### Logging\n- [ ] Risk/chaos tests log a run-level correlationId, injected fault, expected mitigation, observed result, and any generated alert IDs (no secrets).\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md §26 - Risk Register & Mitigations\n- Each mitigation bead for implementation details\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T06:23:51.880257202Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T19:57:16.532836058Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T19:57:16.532836058Z","close_reason":"Risk Mitigations verified complete: Created 40 verification tests in risk-mitigations.test.ts covering all 16 risks.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-lil","title":"TASK: Parity Gate Tests","description":"## Background\n\nParity Gate Tests ensure that the Flywheel Gateway maintains consistency across all its interfaces and documentation. As the system grows with multiple access methods (REST API, WebSocket, CLI, AI-assisted), it becomes critical to verify that:\n\n1. Every command is accessible through all intended interfaces\n2. Documentation stays synchronized with implementation\n3. Schema definitions match actual behavior\n4. No commands are accidentally \"orphaned\" without proper bindings\n\n### The Parity Problem\n\nWithout automated verification, systems tend to drift:\n- New commands added without REST bindings\n- AI hints outdated or missing for commands\n- OpenAPI spec doesn't match actual endpoints\n- WebSocket events undocumented\n- Schema validation inconsistent\n\nParity Gate Tests run in CI to catch these issues before merge.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Test Categories\n\n```typescript\n// scripts/parity-gate.test.ts\n\ndescribe('Command Registry Parity', () => {\n  // Category 1: REST Binding

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-ls4","title":"FEAT: Shared Error Taxonomy + AI Hints","description":"## Background\n\nFlywheel Gateway requires a unified error handling system that serves three distinct audiences:\n1. **Human Developers** - Need clear, actionable error messages during development\n2. **AI Agents** - Need structured hints to understand what went wrong and how to recover\n3. **Client Applications** - Need consistent HTTP status codes and error formats for programmatic handling\n\nThe error taxonomy must be comprehensive enough to cover all failure modes across the gateway ecosystem while remaining extensible for future use cases.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why a Shared Error Package?\n- **Consistency**: All packages (gateway, drivers, SDK) use identical error codes\n- **Type Safety**: TypeScript discriminated unions ensure exhaustive error handling\n- **AI Integration**: Built-in hints help AI agents self-correct without human intervention\n- **Observability**: Structured errors enable better logging, metrics, and alerting\n\n### Error Code Design Philosophy\nError codes follow the pattern: `{DOMAIN}_{SPECIFIC_ERROR}`\n- Domain prefixes: `AGENT_`, `SPAWN_`, `DRIVER_`, `WS_`, `AUTH_`, `RATE_`, `SYSTEM_`\n- This enables filtering/routing by domain while maintaining specificity\n\n## Scope & Requirements\n\n### Core Error Codes to Define\n\n**Agent Lifecycle Errors:**\n- `AGENT_NOT_FOUND` - Agent ID does not exist or was garbage collected\n- `AGENT_ALREADY_EXISTS` - Attempt to spawn with duplicate ID\n- `AGENT_TERMINATED` - Operation on already-terminated agent\n- `AGENT_BUSY` - Agent currently processing, cannot accept new commands\n- `AGENT_TIMEOUT` - Agent did not respond within configured timeout\n\n**Spawn Errors:**\n- `SPAWN_FAILED` - Generic spawn failure (driver-specific details in metadata)\n- `SPAWN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` - User/workspace has reached agent spawn limit\n- `SPAWN_INVALID_CONFIG` - Invalid spawn configuration parameters\n- `SPAWN_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE` - Requested driver not available/healthy\n\n**Driver Errors:**\n- `DRIVER_NOT_FOUND` - Unknown driver type requested\n- `DRIVER_INIT_FAILED` - Driver failed to initialize\n- `DRIVER_COMMUNICATION_ERROR` - Lost connection to underlying agent process\n- `DRIVER_PROTOCOL_ERROR` - Unexpected message format from agent\n\n**WebSocket Errors:**\n- `WS_CONNECTION_FAILED` - Failed to establish WebSocket connection\n- `WS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` - Missing or invalid auth token\n- `WS_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED` - Not authorized for requested channel\n- `WS_CURSOR_EXPIRED` - Requested replay cursor no longer in ring buffer\n- `WS_RATE_LIMITED` - Too many messages/connections\n\n**Authentication/Authorization:**\n- `AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID` - Malformed or expired token\n- `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED` - Token past expiration time\n- `AUTH_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE` - Token lacks required permissions\n- `AUTH_workspace_SUSPENDED` - workspace account suspended\n\n**Rate Limiting:**\n- `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` - Request rate limit exceeded\n- `RATE_CONCURRENT_LIMIT` - Too many concurrent operations\n\n**System Errors:**\n- `SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE` - Service temporarily unavailable\n- `SYSTEM_INTERNAL_ERROR` - Unexpected internal error\n- `SYSTEM_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` - Memory/CPU/disk limits reached\n\n### HTTP Status Mappings\n\n```typescript\nconst HTTP_STATUS_MAP: Record<ErrorCode, number> = {\n  // 4xx Client Errors\n  AGENT_NOT_FOUND: 404,\n  AGENT_ALREADY_EXISTS: 409,\n  AGENT_TERMINATED: 410,  // Gone\n  AGENT_BUSY: 423,        // Locked\n  AGENT_TIMEOUT: 408,\n  \n  SPAWN_INVALID_CONFIG: 400,\n  SPAWN_QUOTA_EXCEEDED: 429,\n  SPAWN_DRIVER_UNAVAILABLE: 503,\n  \n  DRIVER_NOT_FOUND: 400,\n  \n  WS_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED: 401,\n  WS_SUBSCRIPTION_DENIED: 403,\n  WS_CURSOR_EXPIRED: 410,\n  WS_RATE_LIMITED: 429,\n  \n  AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID: 401,\n  AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED: 401,\n  AUTH_INSUFFICIENT_SCOPE: 403,\n  AUTH_workspace_SUSPENDED: 403,\n  \n  RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: 429,\n  RATE_CONCURRENT_LIMIT: 429,\n  \n  // 5xx Server Errors\n  SPAWN_FAILED: 500,\n  DRIVER_INIT_FAILED: 500,\n  DRIVER_COMMUNICATION_ERROR: 502,\n  DRIVER_PROTOCOL_ERROR: 502,\n  WS_CONNECTION_FAILED: 502,\n  SYSTEM_UNAVAILABLE: 503,\n  SYSTEM_INTERNAL_ERROR: 500,\n  SYSTEM_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: 503,\n};\n```\n\n### AI-Friendly Error Structure\n\n```typescript\ninterface GatewayError {\n  code: ErrorCode;\n  message: string;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-mag","title":"Performance Optimization","description":"## Background\n\nAs the Flywheel Gateway scales to handle more agents, sessions, and real-time events, performance becomes critical. Users expect instantaneous UI responses, smooth animations, and efficient resource usage. This bead addresses performance at multiple levels: network (WebSocket), rendering (virtualization), bundle size, and computation offloading.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nPerformance directly impacts user experience and system reliability:\n\n1. **WebSocket Backpressure**: Prevents memory exhaustion when server sends data faster than client can process\n2. **Virtualization**: Enables displaying thousands of log lines without DOM bloat\n3. **Bundle Optimization**: Faster initial load times, especially on mobile networks\n4. **Web Workers**: Keeps UI responsive during heavy computations\n5. **CI Budgets**: Prevents performance regressions from reaching production\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### WebSocket Backpressure Handling\n\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/lib/websocket/BackpressureManager.ts\ninterface BackpressureConfig {\n  highWaterMark: number;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-msz","title":"Conflict Detection and Alerts","description":"## Background\n\nConflict Detection and Alerts provides proactive identification of potential conflicts before they cause problems. While the File Reservation System prevents conflicts through coordination, this system detects conflicts that occur despite reservations or in uncoordinated scenarios.\n\nThree types of conflicts are detected:\n1. **Reservation Overlaps**: Two agents request conflicting file patterns\n2. **Git Conflicts**: Actual merge conflicts in version control\n3. **Resource Contention**: Competition for shared resources (APIs, databases)\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Conflict Types\n```typescript\ntype ConflictType = \n  | 'reservation_overlap'    // Pattern intersection\n  | 'git_merge_conflict'     // Actual file conflict\n  | 'git_potential_conflict' // Same file, different branches\n  | 'resource_contention'    // API rate limits, DB locks\n  | 'deadlock_detected';     // Circular wait condition\n\ninterface Conflict {\n  id: string;\n  type: ConflictType;\n  severity: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error' | 'critical';\n  projectId: string;\n  involvedAgents: string[];\n  affectedResources: string[];  // Files, APIs, etc.\n  detectedAt: Date;\n  resolvedAt?: Date;\n  resolution?: ConflictResolution;\n  metadata: Record<string, any>;\n}\n```\n\n### Detection Strategies\n\n#### 1. Reservation Overlap Detection\nReal-time detection when reservations are created:\n```typescript\nasync detectReservationOverlap(\n  newReservation: ReservationRequest\n): Promise<OverlapConflict[]> {\n  const activeReservations = await this.getActiveReservations(\n    newReservation.projectId\n  );\n  \n  return activeReservations\n    .filter(r => r.agentId !== newReservation.agentId)\n    .map(r => ({\n      existing: r,\n      overlap: this.computeOverlap(r.patterns, newReservation.patterns)\n    }))\n    .filter(r => r.overlap.length > 0);\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Git Conflict Detection\nPeriodic and event-driven git status checking:\n```typescript\nasync detectGitConflicts(projectId: string): Promise<GitConflict[]> {\n  const conflicts: GitConflict[] = [];\n  \n  // Check for actual merge conflicts\n  const mergeStatus = await this.git.status();\n  if (mergeStatus.conflicted.length > 0) {\n    conflicts.push({\n      type: 'git_merge_conflict',\n      files: mergeStatus.conflicted,\n      severity: 'critical'\n    });\n  }\n  \n  // Check for potential conflicts (same file modified on different branches)\n  const branches = await this.getActiveBranches(projectId);\n  for (const [b1, b2] of combinations(branches, 2)) {\n    const commonFiles = await this.findCommonModifiedFiles(b1, b2);\n    if (commonFiles.length > 0) {\n      conflicts.push({\n        type: 'git_potential_conflict',\n        files: commonFiles,\n        branches: [b1, b2],\n        severity: 'warning'\n      });\n    }\n  }\n  \n  return conflicts;\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Resource Contention Detection\nMonitor shared resource access patterns:\n```typescript\ninterface ResourceAccess {\n  resourceId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  accessType: 'read' | 'write' | 'exclusive';\n  timestamp: Date;\n}\n\nasync detectResourceContention(\n  projectId: string,\n  windowMs: number = 5000\n): Promise<ContentionConflict[]> {\n  const recentAccesses = await this.getRecentAccesses(projectId, windowMs);\n  \n  // Group by resource\n  const byResource = groupBy(recentAccesses, 'resourceId');\n  \n  return Object.entries(byResource)\n    .filter(([_, accesses]) => this.hasContention(accesses))\n    .map(([resourceId, accesses]) => ({\n      type: 'resource_contention',\n      resourceId,\n      involvedAgents: unique(accesses.map(a => a.agentId)),\n      severity: 'warning'\n    }));\n}\n```\n\n### Alert System\n\n#### Alert Configuration\n```typescript\ninterface AlertConfig {\n  channels: AlertChannel[];  // websocket, email, slack, webhook\n  thresholds: {\n    [K in ConflictType]: {\n      minSeverity: Severity;\n      cooldownMs: number;    // Prevent alert spam\n    };\n  };\n  escalation: {\n    afterMs: number;\n    escalateTo: AlertChannel[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n#### WebSocket Events\n```typescript\n// Emitted events\n'conflict.detected'     // New conflict found\n'conflict.updated'      // Conflict status changed\n'conflict.resolved'     // Conflict resolved\n'conflict.escalated'    // Conflict escalated\n\n// Event payload\ninterface ConflictEvent {\n  eventType: string;\n  conflict: Conflict;\n  timestamp: Date;\n  recommendedActions: Action[];\n}\n```\n\n### Recommended Actions\nSystem suggests resolutions based on conflict type:\n```typescript\nfunction getRecommendedActions(conflict: Conflict): Action[] {\n  switch (conflict.type) {\n    case 'reservation_overlap':\n      return [\n        { action: 'wait', description: 'Wait for existing reservation to expire' },\n        { action: 'negotiate', description: 'Request partial pattern release' },\n        { action: 'force', description: 'Override (requires admin)' }\n      ];\n    \n    case 'git_merge_conflict':\n      return [\n        { action: 'manual_resolve', description: 'Human intervention required' },\n        { action: 'abort_merge', description: 'Abort and retry later' },\n        { action: 'accept_ours', description: 'Keep current branch changes' },\n        { action: 'accept_theirs', description: 'Accept incoming changes' }\n      ];\n    \n    case 'resource_contention':\n      return [\n        { action: 'queue', description: 'Queue request for later' },\n        { action: 'retry_backoff', description: 'Retry with exponential backoff' },\n        { action: 'alternative', description: 'Use alternative resource' }\n      ];\n    \n    default:\n      return [{ action: 'investigate', description: 'Manual investigation needed' }];\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-o54","title":"ACP Agent Driver","description":"## Background\n\nThe Agent Client Protocol (ACP) driver enables Flywheel Gateway to communicate with external agent processes over JSON-RPC 2.0. Unlike the SDK driver which embeds agent logic directly, the ACP driver treats agents as separate processes that communicate via a standardized protocol.\n\nThis separation provides several critical benefits:\n- Language independence: agents can be written in Python, Rust, Go, etc.\n- Process isolation: agent crashes don't affect the gateway\n- Scalability: agents can run on different machines\n- Development flexibility: agents can be developed and tested independently\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Protocol Design\n- **Transport**: Bidirectional JSON-RPC 2.0 over WebSocket or stdio\n- **Message Types**: Request, Response, Notification\n- **Serialization**: JSON with optional MessagePack for performance\n- **Framing**: Length-prefixed messages for stdio, native WebSocket frames\n\n### Core Methods\n```typescript\n// Gateway -> Agent\nagent.initialize(config: AgentConfig): Promise<void>\nagent.executeTask(task: Task): Promise<TaskResult>\nagent.handleMessage(message: AgentMessage): Promise<void>\nagent.shutdown(): Promise<void>\n\n// Agent -> Gateway (notifications)\ngateway.taskProgress(taskId: string, progress: Progress): void\ngateway.requestTool(toolName: string, params: any): Promise<any>\ngateway.logEvent(event: LogEvent): void\n```\n\n### Connection Lifecycle\n1. Gateway spawns agent process or accepts incoming connection\n2. Handshake with capability negotiation\n3. Agent registers available tools and capabilities\n4. Gateway sends tasks, agent responds\n5. Graceful shutdown with pending task completion\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### AgentDriver Interface Compliance\nThe ACP driver MUST implement the same `AgentDriver` interface as the SDK driver:\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  capabilities: DriverCapabilities;\n  \n  connect(): Promise<void>;\n  disconnect(): Promise<void>;\n  isConnected(): boolean;\n  \n  executeTask(task: Task): Promise<TaskResult>;\n  cancelTask(taskId: string): Promise<void>;\n  \n  on(event: DriverEvent, handler: EventHandler): void;\n  off(event: DriverEvent, handler: EventHandler): void;\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling Strategy\n- Connection errors: exponential backoff with jitter (100ms to 30s)\n- Task timeout: configurable per-task with default 5 minutes\n- Protocol errors: log, notify, attempt recovery\n- Process crashes: detect via exit codes, restart with backoff\n\n### Connection Management\n- Connection pool for multiple agent instances\n- Health checks via ping/pong every 30 seconds\n- Automatic reconnection on disconnect\n- Graceful drain on shutdown\n\n## File Locations\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/index.ts` | Public exports |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/acp-driver.ts` | Main driver implementation |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/protocol.ts` | JSON-RPC message types and serialization |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/connection.ts` | WebSocket/stdio connection handling |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/pool.ts` | Connection pool management |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/errors.ts` | ACP-specific error classes |\n| `packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/__tests__/` | Unit and integration tests |\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Implements AgentDriver interface identically to SDK driver\n- [ ] Supports both WebSocket and stdio transports\n- [ ] JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant message handling\n- [ ] Connection pool with configurable size (default: 5)\n- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff\n- [ ] Health check mechanism with configurable interval\n- [ ] Graceful shutdown drains pending tasks\n- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with typed errors\n- [ ] >90% test coverage for protocol handling\n- [ ] Integration test with mock agent process\n- [ ] Performance: <10ms overhead per message\n\n## References\n\n- PLAN.md Section 5: Agent Driver Architecture\n- PLAN.md Section 6: Protocol Specifications\n- JSON-RPC 2.0 Specification: https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- `ws` - WebSocket client/server\n- `uuid` - Request ID generation\n- Shared types from `@flywheel/types`\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Validate all incoming JSON-RPC messages\n- Limit message size (default: 10MB)\n- Rate limit requests per connection\n- Authentication via shared secret in handshake\n\n\n## Testing Requirements\n\nReference: `flywheel_gateway-d8b`.\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] ACP JSON-RPC request/response parsing validates schema and handles out-of-order responses\n- [ ] Event stream parsing handles tool_call/tool_result/text_delta and preserves ordering\n- [ ] Reconnect/resume logic handles transient disconnects without duplicating events\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] Use a stub ACP agent to run a short session and verify output streaming + interrupts\n\n### Failure Mode Tests\n- [ ] Protocol errors/timeouts map to driver error codes and do not crash the gateway\n\n### E2E Tests\n- [ ] Covered by `flywheel_gateway-tz4` critical-path E2E suite;

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-oul","title":"[Epic] Pagination Standardization","description":"# Epic: Pagination Standardization\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nThe API uses multiple incompatible pagination patterns, making it difficult for clients to implement consistent pagination logic across different resources.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n| Route | Style | Fields Used |\n|-------|-------|-------------|\n| `/agents` | Cursor | `cursor`, `limit`, `pagination.hasMore` |\n| `/conflicts` | Offset | `offset`, `limit`, `total`, `hasMore` |\n| `/conflicts/history` | Offset | `offset`, `limit`, `total`, `hasMore` |\n| `/reservations` | None | `count` only (no actual pagination!) |\n| `/checkpoints` | Hybrid | `limit`, `pagination.total`, `pagination.hasMore` |\n| `/dcg/blocks` | Cursor | `cursor`, `pagination` object |\n| `/history` | Cursor | `cursor`, `hasMore` |\n\n### Why This Matters\n1. **Client Complexity**: Clients must implement 3+ pagination strategies\n2. **Offset Performance**: Offset pagination scales poorly (O(n) for skip)\n3. **Inconsistent Naming**: `hasMore` vs `has_more`, nested vs top-level\n4. **Missing Total Counts**: Some endpoints don't report total items\n\n### Industry Standard (Stripe Pattern)\nStripe exclusively uses cursor-based pagination:\n```json\n{\n  \"object\": \"list\",\n  \"data\": [...],\n  \"has_more\": true,\n  \"url\": \"/v1/charges\"\n}\n```\n\nRequest params:\n- `limit` (default 10, max 100)\n- `starting_after` (cursor - exclusive, forward)\n- `ending_before` (cursor - exclusive, backward)\n\n## Goals\n1. **Unified Pattern**: All list endpoints use cursor-based pagination\n2. **Stable Cursors**: Cursors are opaque strings (not page numbers)\n3. **Bi-directional**: Support both forward and backward navigation\n4. **Efficient**: O(1) seek using indexed cursor columns\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Canonical pagination types defined\n- [ ] Pagination utility functions created\n- [ ] All list endpoints converted to cursor-based\n- [ ] Tests cover pagination edge cases\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Define `PaginationParams` and `PaginatedResponse<T>` types\n2. Create `paginate()` helper for database queries\n3. Create `cursorEncode()`/`cursorDecode()` for opaque cursors\n4. Update each list endpoint systematically\n\n## Cursor Design\nCursors will encode: `{id, sortField, sortDirection}` as base64 JSON.\nThis allows efficient keyset pagination without exposing internals.\n\n## Dependencies\n- Depends on: Response Structure Standardization (for consistent envelope)\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Breaking Change**: Old clients using offset won't work\n  - Mitigation: Support both temporarily, deprecate offset\n- **Sort Order Coupling**: Cursor encodes sort order\n  - Mitigation: Validate cursor matches requested sort","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:57:42.293577439Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T19:53:19.356892867Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T19:53:19.356892867Z","close_reason":"Pagination standardization complete for all local endpoints.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-ox6","title":"DCG: Persist Configuration to Database","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nDCG configuration (enabled/disabled packs) is currently stored only in memory. Server restarts lose all configuration changes, there's no audit trail, and horizontal scaling would have inconsistent state.\n\n## Background\n\nCurrent implementation in `dcg.service.ts`:\n\n```typescript\n// In-memory only - LOST ON RESTART\nlet currentConfig: DCGConfig = {\n  enabledPacks: KNOWN_PACKS,  // All packs enabled by default\n  disabledPacks: [],\n};\n\nexport function updateConfig(config: Partial<DCGConfig>): void {\n  if (config.enabledPacks) currentConfig.enabledPacks = config.enabledPacks;\n  if (config.disabledPacks) currentConfig.disabledPacks = config.disabledPacks;\n  // No persistence! Config lost on restart!\n}\n```\n\n### Problems This Causes\n\n1. **Config lost on server restart** - Any pack enable/disable changes disappear\n2. **No audit trail** - Can't see who changed what, when, or why\n3. **No versioning** - Can't rollback to previous config\n4. **Inconsistent state** - Multiple server instances have different configs\n5. **No change notifications** - Other parts of system don't know when config changes\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1.

state for config changes\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] DCG config persists across server restarts\n- [ ] Config changes create audit trail entries with actor identity\n- [ ] Config history is queryable via REST API with pagination\n- [ ] Config can be rolled back to any previous state\n- [ ] WebSocket event published on every config change\n- [ ] Server startup loads config from DB (not hardcoded defaults)\n- [ ] Cache invalidation works correctly\n- [ ] Concurrent config updates don't corrupt state\n- [ ] All unit tests pass with comprehensive logging\n- [ ] All integration tests pass\n- [ ] All E2E tests pass\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Config changes should require authenticated user\n- History entries record actor identity\n- Rollback operations are audit logged\n- Sensitive pack configurations are not exposed in logs\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T07:44:16.547135888Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T19:44:30.894378962Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T19:44:30.894378962Z","close_reason":"Implemented

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-p0l","title":"FEAT: SLB Safety Guardrails","description":"## Overview\n\nConfigurable safety limits and approval workflows for the Session Lock Broker (SLB). Safety Guardrails provide multi-layered protection against runaway agents, resource abuse, and potentially dangerous operations through declarative rules, rate limiting, and human-in-the-loop approval workflows.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nAutonomous agents operating with tool access pose inherent risks:\n\n- **Runaway Agents**: An agent stuck in a loop can consume unlimited resources or make endless API calls\n- **Resource Abuse**: Without limits, agents can exhaust disk space, network bandwidth, or compute time\n- **Dangerous Operations**: Some operations (forced pushes, recursive deletion, production deployments) require human oversight\n- **Cost Overruns**: LLM token usage and external API calls can generate unexpected expenses\n- **Data Exfiltration**: Agents with network access could potentially leak sensitive information\n\nSafety Guardrails transform these risks into manageable, auditable controls with clear escalation paths.\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Safety Categories\n\n| Category | Scope | Examples |\n|----------|-------|----------|\n| `filesystem` | File and directory operations | Path restrictions, write limits, deletion controls |\n| `git` | Version control operations | Branch protections, forced push blocking, commit limits |\n| `network` | External communication | URL allowlists, request rate limits, data transfer caps |\n| `execution` | Command and script execution | Command blocking, timeout enforcement, process limits |\n| `resources` | System resource usage | Memory caps, CPU limits, disk quotas |\n| `content` | Generated content validation | PII detection, secret scanning, policy compliance |\n\n### Path Allowlists and Denylists\n\n```typescript\ninterface PathRule {\n  pattern: string;      // Glob pattern (e.g., '/workspace/**', '!**/node_modules/**')\n  action: 'allow' | 'deny';\n  operations: ('read' | 'write' | 'delete' | 'execute')[];\n  reason?: string;      // Displayed to agent when blocked\n}\n\n// Evaluation order: deny rules checked first, then allow rules\n// Default: deny if no matching allow rule\n```\n\n### Command Blocking Rules\n\n```typescript\ninterface CommandRule {\n  pattern: string;           // Regex pattern for command matching\n  severity: 'block' | 'warn' | 'approve';\n  category: SafetyCategory;\n  reason: string;\n  alternatives?: string[];   // Suggested safer alternatives\n}\n\n// Example rules:\n// - block: recursive forced deletion from root\n// - approve: forced git push (requires approval)\n// - warn: piping curl output to shell\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\n```typescript\ninterface RateLimitConfig {\n  scope: 'agent' | 'workspace' | 'session';\n  limits: {\n    tokensPerMinute: number;\n    requestsPerMinute: number;\n    fileWritesPerMinute: number;\n    networkRequestsPerMinute: number;\n    commandsPerMinute: number;\n  };\n  burstAllowance: number;    // Percentage above limit for short bursts\n  cooldownSeconds: number;   // Wait time after limit exceeded\n}\n```\n\n### Approval Queue\n\n```typescript\ninterface ApprovalRequest {\n  id: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  sessionId: string;\n  operation: {\n    type: SafetyCategory;\n    command?: string;\n    path?: string;\n    description: string;\n  };\n  rule: SafetyRule;          // Rule that triggered approval\n  context: {\n    recentActions: Action[]; // Last 10 agent actions for context\n    taskDescription?: string;\n  };\n  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied' | 'expired';\n  requestedAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;           // Auto-deny after timeout\n  decidedBy?: string;        // User who approved/denied\n  decidedAt?: Date;\n  decisionReason?: string;\n}\n```\n\n### Cost Limits and Budget Enforcement\n\n```typescript\ninterface BudgetConfig {\n  scope: 'agent' | 'workspace' | 'session';\n  limits: {\n    totalTokens: number;\n    totalDollars: number;\n    perRequestDollars: number;\n  };\n  alertThresholds: number[]; // e.g., [0.5, 0.8, 0.95] for 50%, 80%, 95%\n  action: 'warn' | 'pause' | 'terminate';\n}\n```\n\n## Key Interfaces\n\n```typescript\ninterface SafetyConfig {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  name: string;\n  description?: string;\n  enabled: boolean;\n  categories: {\n    [K in SafetyCategory]: {\n      enabled: boolean;\n      rules: SafetyRule[];\n    };\n  };\n  rateLimits: RateLimitConfig;\n  budget: BudgetConfig;\n  approvalWorkflow: {\n    enabled: boolean;\n    approvers: string[];      // User IDs who can approve\n    timeoutMinutes: number;\n    defaultAction: 'deny' | 'allow';\n  };\n}\n\ninterface SafetyRule {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  category: SafetyCategory;\n  condition: RuleCondition;   // Pattern matching logic\n  action: 'allow' | 'deny' | 'warn' | 'approve';\n  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';\n  message: string;            // Shown to agent/user\n  enabled: boolean;\n}\n\ninterface SafetyViolation {\n  id: string;\n  timestamp: Date;\n  agentId: string;\n  sessionId: string;\n  rule: SafetyRule;\n  operation: {\n    type: string;\n    details: Record<string, unknown>;\n  };\n  action: 'blocked' | 'warned' | 'pending_approval';\n  context: {\n    taskDescription?: string;\n    recentHistory: string[];\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## File Locations\n\n| Component | Path |\n|-----------|------|\n| Safety

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-p8j","title":"FEAT: Beads/BV Integration","description":"## Background\n\nThe Beads Viewer (BV) is the central intelligence layer of the Flywheel ecosystem, managing the dependency graph of all work items (beads). This integration enables Flywheel Gateway to leverage BV's graph-aware capabilities for intelligent work prioritization and bottleneck detection.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nCurrent task management systems treat work items as independent entities, leading to:\n- Developers picking up blocked work they cannot complete\n- Critical path items languishing while non-blocking work proceeds\n- No visibility into which completions would unblock the most downstream work\n- Manual effort to determine work dependencies\n\nBV solves this by maintaining a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of beads and their dependencies, enabling queries like \"what can I work on right now?\" and \"what's blocking the most work?\"\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Client Architecture\n- Use flywheel-clients package pattern for consistency\n- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff\n- Cache dependency graph locally with invalidation strategy\n- Support both REST and potential WebSocket for real-time updates\n\n### API Design\n```typescript\ninterface BVClient {\n  // CRUD Operations\n  createBead(bead: BeadCreate): Promise<Bead>;\n  getBead(id: string): Promise<Bead>;\n  updateBead(id: string, updates: BeadUpdate): Promise<Bead>;\n  deleteBead(id: string): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Triage Operations\n  getReadyBeads(filters?: TriageFilters): Promise<Bead[]>;\n  getBlockedBeads(filters?: TriageFilters): Promise<BlockedBead[]>;\n  triageWork(context: TriageContext): Promise<PrioritizedWork>;\n  \n  // Insights\n  getBottlenecks(limit?: number): Promise<Bottleneck[]>;\n  getKeystones(limit?: number): Promise<Keystone[]>;\n  getDependencyGraph(rootId?: string): Promise<DependencyGraph>;\n  \n  // Dependency Management\n  addDependency(beadId: string, dependsOn: string): Promise<void>;\n  removeDependency(beadId: string, dependsOn: string): Promise<void>;\n  getBlockers(beadId: string): Promise<Bead[]>;\n  getDependents(beadId: string): Promise<Bead[]>;\n}\n```\n\n### Galaxy View (Dependency Visualization)\nThe Galaxy View renders the dependency graph as an interactive visualization:\n- Nodes represent beads, sized by downstream impact\n- Edges show dependency relationships\n- Color coding: ready (green), blocked (red), in-progress (yellow)\n- Zoom/pan for large graphs\n- Click to drill into bead details\n- Filter by project, tag, assignee\n\n### Performance Requirements\n- Triage queries must return in <100ms for responsive UI\n- Graph rendering must handle 1000+ nodes smoothly\n- Use WebGL (via @xyflow/react (ReactFlow) or similar) for large graphs\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **BV Client Implementation**\n   - [ ] BVClient class with full TypeScript typing\n   - [ ] All CRUD operations functional\n   - [ ] Error handling with typed exceptions\n   - [ ] Request/response logging for debugging\n   - [ ] Unit tests with >80% coverage\n\n2. **Triage API Integration**\n   - [ ] getReadyBeads returns beads with no unresolved blockers\n   - [ ] getBlockedBeads includes blocker information\n   - [ ] triageWork returns prioritized list considering:\n     - User skills/preferences\n     - Bead priority\n     - Downstream impact (keystone score)\n     - Time estimates\n\n3. **Insights API Integration**\n   - [ ] Bottleneck detection working (beads blocking most downstream work)\n   - [ ] Keystone identification (highest-impact completions)\n   - [ ] Metrics include: blocked count, estimated unblock value\n\n4. **Dependency Management**\n   - [ ] Add/remove dependencies with cycle detection\n   - [ ] Bulk dependency operations\n   - [ ] Dependency validation (no self-references, no cycles)\n\n5. **Galaxy View Component**\n   - [ ] Interactive graph rendering\n   - [ ] Node click shows bead details sidebar\n   - [ ] Filter controls (status, project, assignee)\n   - [ ] Legend explaining visual encoding\n   - [ ] Export graph as image/SVG\n   -

Without proper cost visibility and optimization, expenses can spiral unexpectedly. This bead implements comprehensive cost analytics that provide real-time visibility into AI usage, predictive forecasting to prevent budget overruns, and AI-powered optimization recommendations to reduce costs while maintaining quality.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nCost management for AI agents is uniquely challenging because:\n- **Variable Rates**: Different models have vastly different costs (GPT-4 vs Claude Haiku)\n- **Usage Patterns**: Costs vary by time of day, task type, and agent behavior\n- **Hidden Costs**: Retries, context overflow, and inefficient prompts inflate costs\n- **Rapid Growth**: Agent fleets can scale quickly, multiplying costs\n\nThe solution must provide:\n- Granular cost attribution to understand where resources goes\n- Proactive alerts before budgets are exhausted\n- Actionable recommendations with quantified savings\n- Historical analysis to identify cost trends and anomalies\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n### Cost Tracking Architecture\n\n**Cost Attribution Dimensions:**\n```typescript\ninterface CostRecord {\n  timestamp: Date;\n  organization_id: string;\n  project_id: string;\n  agent_id: string;\n  task_id: string;\n  model: string;\n  provider: 'anthropic' | 'openai' | 'google' | 'local';\n  \n  // Token breakdown\n  prompt_tokens: number;\n  completion_tokens: number;\n  cached_tokens: number;\n  \n  // Cost calculation\n  prompt_cost_units: number;\n  completion_cost_units: number;\n  total_cost_units: number;\n  \n  // Context\n  task_type: string;\n  complexity_tier: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';\n  success: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n**Real-time Cost Aggregation:**\n- Per-minute cost accumulation for real-time dashboards\n- Hourly rollups for trend analysis\n- Daily aggregates for reporting\n- Monthly summaries for reporting\n\n**Cost by Model:**\n```typescript\ninterface ModelCostBreakdown {\n  model: string;\n  total_cost_units: number;\n  percentage_of_total: number;\n  request_count: number;\n  avg_cost_per_request: number;\n  total_tokens: number;\n  cost_per_1k_tokens: number;\n  trend: CostTrend;\n}\n```\n\n**Cost by Agent:**\n- Individual agent cost tracking\n- Agent cost ranking (top spenders)\n- Cost per successful task by agent\n- Agent efficiency comparison\n\n**Cost by Task Type:**\n- Task classification for cost attribution\n- Cost benchmarks by task type\n- Anomaly detection for expensive tasks\n- Task type optimization opportunities\n\n### Budget Status Visualization\n\n**Budget Configuration:**\n```typescript\ninterface Budget {\n  id: string;\n  organization_id: string;\n  period: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly';\n  amount_units: number;\n  alert_thresholds: number[]; // e.g., [50, 75, 90, 100]\n  action_on_exceed: 'alert' | 'throttle' | 'block';\n  rollover: boolean;\n  effective_date: Date;\n}\n```\n\n**Visual Progress Indicators:**\n- Circular progress gauge (0-100%)\n- Color coding: green (<50%), yellow (50-80%), orange (80-95%), red (>95%)\n- Burn rate indicator (current vs expected)\n- Days remaining at current rate\n- Comparison to previous period\n\n**Budget Alerts:**\n- Threshold-based notifications\n- Predictive alerts (\"Will exceed budget in 3 days\")\n- Spike detection (\"Cost increased 300% in last hour\")\n- Recovery notification when usage normalizes\n\n### 30-Day Cost Forecasting\n\n**Forecasting Model:**\n```typescript\ninterface CostForecast {\n  forecast_date: Date;\n  horizon_days: 30;\n  daily_forecasts: DailyForecast[];\n  total_forecast_units: number;\n  confidence_interval_95: {\n    lower: number;\n    upper: number;\n  };\n  methodology: 'arima' | 'prophet' | 'linear' | 'ensemble';\n  accuracy_metrics: {\n    mape: number; // Mean Absolute Percentage Error\n    rmse: number; // Root Mean Square Error\n  };\n}\n\ninterface DailyForecast {\n  date: Date;\n  predicted_cost_units: number;\n  lower_bound_units: number;\n  upper_bound_units: number;\n  confidence: number;\n}\n```\n\n**Forecasting Methodology:**\n1. **Historical Analysis**: Use 90 days of historical data\n2. **Seasonality Detection**: Weekly and monthly patterns\n3. **Trend Extraction**: Linear and exponential trends\n4. **Anomaly Handling**: Exclude outliers from training\n5. **Ensemble Approach**: Combine multiple models for robustness\n\n**Confidence Intervals:**\n- 95% confidence intervals for each day\n- Widening intervals for further predictions\n- Scenario modeling (optimistic, expected, pessimistic)\n- Sensitivity analysis for key drivers\n\n### AI-Powered Optimization Recommendations\n\n**Recommendation Categories:**\n\n1. **Model Optimization:**\n```typescript\n{\n  category: 'model_optimization',\n  title: 'Switch documentation tasks to Claude Haiku',\n  description: 'Analysis shows 847 documentation tasks last month used Claude Sonnet.

Maintains registry of agent-to-branch mappings\n   - Enforces exclusive branch ownership\n   - Supports branch reservation with TTL\n   - Handles branch release on agent completion/timeout\n\n2. **Conflict Prediction Engine**\n   - Analyzes pending changes across all active branches\n   - Detects overlapping file modifications before they occur\n   - Uses git diff-tree for file-level conflict detection\n   - Provides semantic conflict hints (same function modified)\n\n3. **Sync Operations Manager**\n   - Coordinates pull operations with conflict checking\n   - Manages commit sequencing for dependent changes\n   - Handles push operations with retry logic\n   - Supports atomic multi-branch operations\n\n4. **Merge Base Analyzer**\n   - Tracks merge base for all active branches\n   - Calculates branch divergence metrics\n   - Recommends rebase timing\n   - Detects stale branches requiring attention\n\n### Frontend Components\n\n1. **BranchVisualization.tsx**\n   - D3.js-based git graph rendering\n   - Real-time branch status updates via WebSocket\n   - Interactive branch selection and comparison\n   - Commit history timeline\n\n2. **ConflictPredictor.tsx**\n   -

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-tt0","title":"[Epic] API Response Structure Standardization","description":"# Epic: API Response Structure Standardization\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nThe Flywheel Gateway API currently uses inconsistent response structures across different endpoints. This creates cognitive overhead for developers integrating with the API and makes it harder to build robust client libraries.\n\n### Current State Analysis\nDifferent endpoints use different response wrapper patterns:\n\n1. **Wrapped in specific property:**\n   - `{ reservation: {...}, correlationId }` (reservations.ts)\n   - `{ config: {...}, correlationId }` (dcg.ts)\n   - `{ checkpoint: {...}, links: {...}, correlationId }` (checkpoints.ts)\n\n2. **Spread at top level:**\n   - `{ ...result, links: {...} }` (agents.ts:168-178)\n\n3. **Duplicated keys:**\n   - `{ ...triage, triage: {...} }` (beads.ts - duplicates \"triage\" key)\n\n### Industry Standard (Stripe Pattern)\nStripe uses a highly consistent envelope pattern:\n```json\n{\n  \"object\": \"checkpoint\",\n  \"data\": { ... resource fields ... },\n  \"livemode\": true\n}\n```\n\nFor lists:\n```json\n{\n  \"object\": \"list\",\n  \"data\": [ ... items ... ],\n  \"has_more\": true,\n  \"url\": \"/v1/checkpoints\"\n}\n```\n\n## Goals\n1. **Consistency**: Every endpoint returns predictably structured responses\n2. **Discoverability**: Clients can introspect response type via `object` field\n3. **Extensibility**: Envelope can carry metadata without breaking changes\n4. **Developer Experience**: Reduced cognitive load, easier debugging\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All REST endpoints use canonical response envelope\n- [ ] TypeScript types defined for response envelopes\n- [ ] Utility functions created for wrapping responses\n- [ ] All existing tests updated and passing\n- [ ] API documentation reflects new structure\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Define canonical types in @flywheel/shared\n2. Create response wrapper utilities\n3. Systematically update each route file\n4. Update tests to match new structure\n\n## Estimated Scope\n- 12+ route files to update\n- ~50+ endpoint responses to standardize\n- Shared package updates required\n\n## Dependencies\nThis epic should be completed before other API improvements as it establishes the foundation.\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Breaking Change**: Document migration path, consider versioned endpoints\n- **Large Scope**: Break into small, testable increments per route file","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:57:22.255410279Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T16:07:27.169718509Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T16:07:27.169718509Z","close_reason":"All routes updated to use canonical response envelope","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-tz4","title":"Comprehensive Testing Suite","description":"## Background\n\nA production-ready application requires comprehensive testing at multiple levels to ensure reliability, catch regressions, and enable confident deployments. The Flywheel Gateway, with its real-time WebSocket communication, database interactions, and complex UI, needs a robust testing strategy covering unit, integration, contract, E2E, load, and visual regression testing.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nEach testing layer serves a specific purpose:\n\n1. **Unit Tests**: Fast feedback on individual functions/components (seconds)\n2. **Integration Tests**: Verify components work together correctly\n3. **Contract Tests**: Ensure API matches OpenAPI specification\n4. **E2E Tests**: Validate critical user journeys end-to-end\n5. **Load Tests**: Verify system handles expected and peak loads\n6. **Visual Regression**: Catch unintended UI changes\n\nThe combination provides defense in depth - if one layer misses a bug, another should catch it.\n\n##

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-vem","title":"Implement lazy route loading with code splitting","description":"## Task\nRefactor router.tsx to use lazy route imports for automatic code splitting with Suspense boundaries and skeleton loading states.\n\n## Files to Modify\n1. apps/web/src/router.tsx (lines 8-20, 26-80)\n2. apps/web/src/components/skeletons/ (NEW directory)\n3. apps/web/src/App.tsx (Suspense wrapper if needed)\n\n## Current State (Static Imports)\n```typescript\nimport { DashboardPage } from \"./pages/Dashboard\";\nimport { FleetPage } from \"./pages/Fleet\";\nimport { AgentPage } from \"./pages/Agent\";\n// All 8 pages bundled into single chunk (~150kb+)\n```\n\n## Target State (Lazy Imports with Skeletons)\n```typescript\nimport { lazy, Suspense } from \"react\";\n\n// Lazy-loaded pages with named exports for better debugging\nconst DashboardPage = lazy(() => \n  import(\"./pages/Dashboard\").then(m => ({ default: m.DashboardPage }))\n);\nconst FleetPage = lazy(() => \n  import(\"./pages/Fleet\").then(m => ({ default: m.FleetPage }))\n);\n\n// Page-specific skeleton components\nimport { DashboardSkeleton } from \"./components/skeletons/DashboardSkeleton\";\nimport { FleetSkeleton } from \"./components/skeletons/FleetSkeleton\";\n\n// Route with skeleton\nconst dashboardRoute = createRoute({\n  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,\n  path: \"/\",\n  component: () => (\n    <Suspense fallback={<DashboardSkeleton />}>\n      <DashboardPage />\n    </Suspense>\n  ),\n});\n\n// OR using TanStack Router's pendingComponent:\nconst dashboardRoute = createRoute({\n  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,\n  path: \"/\",\n  pendingComponent: DashboardSkeleton,\n  component: DashboardPage,\n});\n```\n\n## Skeleton Components to Create\nEach skeleton should match the layout of its page to prevent layout shift:\n\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/components/skeletons/DashboardSkeleton.tsx\nexport function DashboardSkeleton() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"dashboard-skeleton\" aria-busy=\"true\" aria-label=\"Loading dashboard\">\n      <div className=\"skeleton skeleton--header\" />\n      <div className=\"skeleton-grid\">\n        <div className=\"skeleton skeleton--card\" />\n        <div className=\"skeleton skeleton--card\" />\n        <div className=\"skeleton skeleton--card\" />\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"skeleton skeleton--table\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Similar for: FleetSkeleton, AgentSkeleton, PipelinesSkeleton, etc.\n```\n\n## Pages to Convert (8 total)\n| Page | Priority | Skeleton Complexity |\n|------|----------|---------------------|\n| DashboardPage | High | Medium (cards + metrics) |\n| FleetPage | High | Medium (table + cards) |\n| AgentPage | High | High (output stream + tools) |\n| PipelinesPage | Medium | Medium (graph + list) |\n| TimelinePage | Medium | Low (timeline list) |\n| DashboardsPage | Medium | Medium (widget grid) |\n| SettingsPage | Low | Low (form) |\n| NotFoundPage | Keep static | N/A (small, always needed) |\n\n## Prefetching Strategy\n```typescript\n// Prefetch likely next routes on hover/focus\nconst FleetLink = () => (\n  <Link \n    to=\"/fleet\"\n    onMouseEnter={() => router.preloadRoute({ to: \"/fleet\" })}\n    onFocus={() => router.preloadRoute({ to: \"/fleet\" })}\n  >\n    Fleet\n  </Link>\n);\n\n// Or declarative

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-vg3","title":"[Epic] HATEOAS Links Standardization","description":"# Epic: HATEOAS Links Standardization\n\n## Background & Problem Statement\nHATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is an architectural principle where API responses include links to related resources and actions. Currently, only some endpoints include links, creating an inconsistent experience.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**Endpoints WITH links (good):**\n```typescript\n// agents.ts:168-178\nlinks: {\n  self: `${baseUrl}/agents/${result.agentId}`,\n  output: `${baseUrl}/agents/${result.agentId}/output`,\n  ws: `${toWebSocketUrl(baseUrl)}/agents/${result.agentId}/ws`,\n}\n\n// checkpoints.ts:223-226\nlinks: {\n  self: `${baseUrl}/sessions/${sessionId}/checkpoints/${metadata.id}`,\n  restore: `${baseUrl}/sessions/${sessionId}/checkpoints/${metadata.id}/restore`,\n}\n```\n\n**Endpoints WITHOUT links (inconsistent):**\n- `/reservations` - no links to individual reservations\n- `/conflicts` - no links to resolve endpoint\n- `/dcg/blocks` - no links to mark false positive\n- `/mail/messages` - no links to reply endpoint\n- `/beads` - no links to related beads\n\n### Why HATEOAS Matters\n1. **Discoverability**: Clients learn available actions from responses\n2. **Decoupling**: Clients don't hardcode URL patterns\n3. **Evolution**: URLs can change without breaking clients\n4. **Self-Documentation**: Responses show what's possible\n\n### Industry Standards\nGitHub API includes links:\n```json\n{\n  \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World\",\n  \"html_url\": \"https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World\",\n  \"issues_url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World/issues{/number}\"\n}\n```\n\n## Goals\n1. **Consistency**: All resource responses include relevant links\n2. **Actionable**: Links point to next logical actions\n3. **Templated**: Use URI templates for parameterized links\n4. **Documented**: Link relations are well-defined\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Link generation utility created\n- [ ] All single-resource responses include `links` object\n- [ ] All list responses include `url` for the list endpoint\n- [ ] Links include common actions (self, delete, update, related)\n- [ ] Tests verify link presence and correctness\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Create `generateLinks(resourceType, resourceId, baseUrl)` utility\n2. Define link relations per resource type\n3. Add `links` to all resource response handlers\n4. Include `url` in list responses\n\n## Link Relations by Resource Type\n\n**Agent:**\n- `self`: GET agent details\n- `output`: GET agent output\n- `status`: GET agent status\n- `ws`: WebSocket connection\n- `terminate`: DELETE agent\n- `send`: POST send message\n- `interrupt`: POST interrupt\n\n**Reservation:**\n- `self`: GET reservation\n- `release`: DELETE reservation\n- `renew`: POST renew\n\n**Checkpoint:**\n- `self`: GET checkpoint\n- `restore`: POST restore\n- `export`: GET export\n- `delete`: DELETE checkpoint\n\n**Conflict:**\n- `self`: GET conflict details\n- `resolve`: POST resolve\n\n## Dependencies\n- Response Structure Standardization (links go in envelope)\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **URL Coupling**: Links expose URL structure\n  - Mitigation: Clients should follow links, not construct URLs\n- **Performance**: Generating links adds overhead\n  - Mitigation: Cache baseUrl, use string interpolation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:58:51.392095375Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:41:35.477006710Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:41:35.477006710Z","close_reason":"Added HATEOAS links to 5 routes (reservations, mail, jobs, dcg, supervisor) + job link generators in utils/links.ts.

This causes runtime errors, data loss, and prevents proper DCG integration.\n\n## Background\n\nDuring code exploration, the following issues were identified in `apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts` and `apps/gateway/src/services/dcg.service.ts`:\n\n### dcgBlocks Table Issues\n\n**Current schema:**\n```typescript\nexport const dcgBlocks = sqliteTable(\"dcg_blocks\", {\n  id: text(\"id\").primaryKey(),\n  pattern: text(\"pattern\").notNull(),\n  reason: text(\"reason\").notNull(),\n  createdBy: text(\"created_by\"),\n  falsePositive: integer(\"false_positive\", { mode: \"boolean\" }).default(false),\n  createdAt: integer(\"created_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }).default(sql`(unixepoch())`),\n});\n```\n\n**What service expects (DCGBlockEvent interface):**\n- `id: string` ✅\n- `timestamp: Date` → maps to `createdAt` ✅\n- `agentId: string` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN**\n- `command: string` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN** (the actual blocked command)\n- `pack: string` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN** (e.g., \"core.git\", \"database.postgresql\")\n- `pattern: string` ✅\n- `ruleId: string` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN** (e.g., \"core.git:reset-hard\")\n- `severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN**\n- `reason: string` ✅\n- `contextClassification: 'executed' | 'data' | 'ambiguous'` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN**\n- `falsePositive?: boolean` ✅\n- `allowlisted?: boolean` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN**\n\n### dcgAllowlist Table Issues\n\n**Current schema:**\n```typescript\nexport const dcgAllowlist = sqliteTable(\"dcg_allowlist\", {\n  id: text(\"id\").primaryKey(),\n  ruleId: text(\"rule_id\").unique().notNull(),\n  pattern: text(\"pattern\").notNull(),\n  approvedBy: text(\"approved_by\"),\n  expiresAt: integer(\"expires_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }),\n  createdAt: integer(\"created_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }).default(sql`(unixepoch())`),\n});\n```\n\n**What service expects (DCGAllowlistEntry interface):**\n- `ruleId: string` ✅\n- `pattern: string` ✅\n- `addedAt: Date` ❌ **SERVICE USES addedAt, SCHEMA HAS createdAt**\n- `addedBy: string` ❌ **SERVICE USES addedBy, SCHEMA HAS approvedBy**\n- `reason: string` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN**\n- `expiresAt?: Date` ✅\n- `condition?: string` ❌ **MISSING COLUMN** (e.g., \"CI=true\")\n\n### Additional Issues\n\n1. **markFalsePositive() bug**: Tries to set `updatedAt` field that doesn't exist\n2. **No indexes**: Missing indexes on frequently queried columns\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Update dcgBlocks Schema\n\n```typescript\nexport const dcgBlocks = sqliteTable(\"dcg_blocks\", {\n  id: text(\"id\").primaryKey(),\n  \n  // Command details\n  command: text(\"command\").notNull(),          // ADD: The blocked command (redacted)\n  commandHash: text(\"command_hash\"),           // ADD: SHA256 for deduplication\n  \n  // Rule details\n  pack: text(\"pack\").notNull(),                // ADD: e.g., \"core.git\"\n  pattern: text(\"pattern\").notNull(),\n  ruleId: text(\"rule_id\").notNull(),           // ADD: e.g., \"core.git:reset-hard\"\n  severity: text(\"severity\").notNull(),        // ADD: critical|high|medium|low\n  reason: text(\"reason\").notNull(),\n  \n  // Context\n  agentId: text(\"agent_id\"),                   // ADD: Which agent triggered\n  contextClassification: text(\"context_classification\"), // ADD: executed|data|ambiguous\n  \n  // Status\n  falsePositive: integer(\"false_positive\", { mode: \"boolean\" }).default(false),\n  allowlisted: integer(\"allowlisted\", { mode: \"boolean\" }).default(false),  // ADD\n  \n  // Timestamps\n  createdAt: integer(\"created_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }).default(sql`(unixepoch())`),\n  updatedAt: integer(\"updated_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }),  // ADD\n}, (table) => ({\n  agentIdx: index(\"dcg_blocks_agent_idx\").on(table.agentId),\n  packIdx: index(\"dcg_blocks_pack_idx\").on(table.pack),\n  severityIdx: index(\"dcg_blocks_severity_idx\").on(table.severity),\n  createdAtIdx: index(\"dcg_blocks_created_at_idx\").on(table.createdAt),\n  ruleIdIdx: index(\"dcg_blocks_rule_id_idx\").on(table.ruleId),\n}));\n```\n\n### 2. Update dcgAllowlist Schema\n\n```typescript\nexport const dcgAllowlist = sqliteTable(\"dcg_allowlist\", {\n  id: text(\"id\").primaryKey(),\n  ruleId: text(\"rule_id\").unique().notNull(),\n  pattern: text(\"pattern\").notNull(),\n  reason: text(\"reason\").notNull(),            // ADD: Why this was allowlisted\n  condition: text(\"condition\"),                // ADD: Optional condition (e.g., \"CI=true\")\n  \n  // Actor tracking (RENAME for consistency with service)\n  addedBy: text(\"added_by\"),                   // RENAME from approvedBy\n  \n  // Timestamps (RENAME for consistency)\n  addedAt: integer(\"added_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }).default(sql`(unixepoch())`),  // RENAME from createdAt\n  expiresAt: integer(\"expires_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }),\n  updatedAt: integer(\"updated_at\", { mode: \"timestamp\" }),  // ADD\n}, (table) => ({\n  ruleIdIdx: index(\"dcg_allowlist_rule_id_idx\").on(table.ruleId),\n  addedAtIdx: index(\"dcg_allowlist_added_at_idx\").on(table.addedAt),\n}));\n```\n\n### 3. Migration Strategy\n\nGenerate migration with `bun db:generate`, then apply with `bun db:migrate`. Migration must:\n- Add new columns with appropriate defaults\n- Rename columns where needed (approvedBy → addedBy, createdAt → addedAt in allowlist)\n- Create all indexes\n- Preserve existing data\n\n### 4. Update Service Layer\n\nAfter schema changes, update `dcg.service.ts` to:\n- Use correct field names consistently\n- Handle all new fields in insert/select operations\n- Add proper type validation with Zod schemas\n- Update markFalsePositive to set updatedAt correctly\n\n## File Locations\n\n- `apps/gateway/src/db/schema.ts` - Schema definitions\n- `apps/gateway/src/db/migrations/` - Migration

successfully on existing database\n- [ ] Migration preserves existing data (no data loss)\n- [ ] All DCG service tests pass with new schema\n- [ ] Indexes exist for common query patterns (agent, pack, severity, date)\n- [ ] markFalsePositive correctly updates the updatedAt field\n- [ ] All unit tests pass with comprehensive logging\n- [ ] All integration tests pass with comprehensive logging\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n1. **Backup before migration**: Always backup database before running migration\n2. **Test migration on copy**: Run migration on copy of production DB first\n3. **Reversible migration**: Define down migration for rollback capability\n4. **Staged rollout**: Deploy schema changes before code changes that depend on them\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-11T07:43:49.222673993Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-11T08:24:36.027661410Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T08:24:36.027661410Z","close_reason":"Fixed

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-w4g","title":"FEAT: Basic REST API (Spawn, Terminate, List, Send)","description":"## Background\n\nThe REST API is the primary interface for clients to interact with the Flywheel Gateway. It exposes agent lifecycle operations (spawn, terminate, list) and communication endpoints (send messages, get output).\n\nThe API design follows REST conventions while accommodating the unique needs of agent orchestration - long-running operations, streaming responses, and event-driven state changes.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why Hono?\n- **Performance**: Built on Web Standards (Request/Response), extremely fast\n- **TypeScript First**: Excellent type inference and validation\n- **Middleware Ecosystem**: Easy to compose with auth, logging, validation\n- **Edge Ready**: Works in Node, Deno, Bun, and edge runtimes\n- **Small Footprint**: Minimal dependencies, fast cold starts\n\n### Command Registry Pattern\nRoutes are generated from a declarative command registry:\n- Single source of truth for all commands\n- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation\n- Consistent validation and error handling\n- Easy to extend with new commands\n\n### Correlation IDs\nEvery request gets a correlation ID that flows through:\n- API logs\n- Agent driver calls\n- WebSocket messages\n- Error responses\n\nThis enables end-to-end request tracing.\n\n## Scope & Requirements\n\n### Core Endpoints\n\n```typescript\n// Agent Lifecycle\nPOST   /agents                    // Spawn new agent\nGET    /agents                    // List agents (with filters)\nGET    /agents/:agentId           // Get agent details\nDELETE /agents/:agentId           // Terminate agent\n\n// Agent Communication\nPOST   /agents/:agentId/send      // Send message to agent\nPOST   /agents/:agentId/interrupt // Send interrupt signal\nGET    /agents/:agentId/output    // Get output (polling, with cursor)\n\n// Health & Info\nGET    /health                    // Health check\nGET    /health/ready

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-w55","title":"FEAT: SDK Agent Driver Implementation","description":"## Background\n\nThe SDK Agent Driver is the primary mechanism for spawning and managing Claude Code agents within the Flywheel Gateway. It wraps the official `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` package, providing a consistent interface that can be extended with alternative drivers (Docker, remote, mock) in the future.\n\nThis driver is the heart of agent lifecycle management - it must handle the full spectrum of agent states, gracefully manage failures, and provide clean abstractions for the gateway layer above.\n\n## Technical Rationale\n\n### Why an AgentDriver Interface?\n- **Pluggability**: Different environments need different agent backends (local SDK, Docker containers, remote clusters)\n- **Testability**: Mock drivers enable gateway testing without spawning real agents\n- **Future-Proofing**: New agent types (Claude 4, custom models) plug in via new drivers\n\n### State Machine Design\nAgents have complex lifecycles. A formal state machine prevents invalid transitions and makes behavior predictable:\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n                    │                                         │\n                    ▼                                         │\n┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌───────────┐  │\n│ pending │───▶│ spawning │───▶│  ready  │◀──▶│ executing │──┤\n└─────────┘    └──────────┘    └─────────┘    └───────────┘  │\n                    │               │              │          │\n                    │               │              │          │\n                    ▼               ▼              ▼          │\n               ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐   │\n               │              terminated                  │◀──┘\n               └─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nValid transitions:\n- `pending → spawning`: Driver begins spawn process\n- `spawning → ready`: Agent process started, SDK connected\n- `spawning → terminated`: Spawn failed\n- `ready → executing`: Command sent to agent\n- `executing → ready`: Command completed\n- `executing → paused`: Interrupt received (SIGTSTP equivalent)\n- `paused → executing`: Resume command sent\n- `* → terminated`: Terminate called or fatal error\n\n### PTY Integration\nAgents need terminal I/O for:\n- Interactive tool use (editors, REPLs)\n- Proper signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z)\n- Terminal resize events\n- Raw mode for special characters\n\n## Scope & Requirements\n\n### AgentDriver Interface\n\n```typescript\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  readonly driverId: string;\n  readonly driverType: 'sdk' | 'docker' | 'remote' | 'mock';\n  \n  // Lifecycle\n  spawn(config: SpawnConfig): Promise<AgentHandle>;\n  terminate(agentId: string, options?: TerminateOptions): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Communication\n  send(agentId: string, message: AgentMessage): Promise<void>;\n  interrupt(agentId: string, signal?: InterruptSignal): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // State\n  getState(agentId: string): AgentState;\n  getOutput(agentId: string, cursor?: string): AsyncIterable<OutputChunk>;\n  \n  // Events\n  on(event: DriverEvent, handler: DriverEventHandler): void;\n  off(event: DriverEvent, handler: DriverEventHandler): void;\n}\n\ninterface SpawnConfig {\n  agentId: string;\n  workingDirectory: string;\n  environment?: Record<string, string>;\n  pty?: PtyConfig;\n  timeout?: number;\n  maxTokens?: number;\n  systemPrompt?: string;\n  tools?: ToolDefinition[];\n  mcpServers?: McpServerConfig[];\n}\n\ninterface AgentHandle {\n  agentId: string;\n  state: AgentState;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  pid?: number;\n  ptyFd?: number;\n}\n\ninterface TerminateOptions {\n  graceful?: boolean;      // Try SIGTERM before SIGKILL\n  timeoutMs?: number;      // Max time to wait for graceful shutdown\n  preserveOutput?: boolean; // Keep output in buffer after termination\n}\n\ntype InterruptSignal = 'SIGINT' | 'SIGTSTP' | 'SIGCONT' | 'SIGHUP';\n```\n\n### SDK Driver Specifics\n\nThe SDK driver wraps `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`:\n\n```typescript\nclass SdkAgentDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly driverId = 'sdk-primary';\n  readonly driverType = 'sdk';\n  \n  private agents: Map<string, SdkAgentContext>;\n  private eventEmitter: EventEmitter;\n  \n  constructor(private config: SdkDriverConfig) {}\n  \n  async spawn(config: SpawnConfig): Promise<AgentHandle> {\n    // 1.

Skip this if you're already familiar with the Agent Flywheel ecosystem.\n\n### The Problem: AI Agents Working in Isolation\n\nThe AI coding agent revolution is here. Tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Codex can write code, run tests, and even debug complex issues. But there's a fundamental problem:\n\n**AI agents work in isolation.**\n\nWhen you run Claude Code on a project, it operates alone. It doesn't know:\n- What other agents are working on the same codebase\n- What decisions were made in previous sessions\n- Which files another agent is currently editing\n- What patterns have worked (or failed) in similar past tasks\n- Whether the code it's about to write will conflict with parallel work\n\nThis isolation creates waste:\n- **Duplicate work** — Two agents solve the same problem differently\n- **Merge conflicts** — Agents edit the same files simultaneously\n- **Lost knowledge** — Insights from one session don't carry to the next\n- **No coordination** — Agents can't delegate, escalate, or collaborate\n- **Human bottleneck** — You become the message-passing middleware between agents\n\n### The Vision: The Agent Flywheel\n\nThe **Agent Flywheel** is a self-improving development cycle where AI coding agents work in parallel, coordinate via messaging, and compound their learnings over time.\n\n```\n                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n                    │         THE AGENT FLYWHEEL              │\n                    │      (Self-Reinforcing Cycle)           │\n                    └─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n                              ┌──────────┐\n                              │   PLAN   │\n                              │   (BV)   │\n                              └────┬─────┘\n                                   │\n            What work is ready?    │    Graph analysis reveals\n            What's blocked?        │    optimal task ordering\n            What's the critical    │\n            path?                  ▼\n                              ┌──────────┐\n         ┌────────────────────│COORDINATE│────────────────────┐\n         │                    │(Ag Mail) │                    │\n         │                    └────┬─────┘                    │\n         │                         │                          │\n         │  Agents claim work,     │   Reserve files,         │\n         │  message each other,    │   resolve conflicts,     │\n         │  share discoveries      │   handoff context        │\n         │                         ▼                          │\n         │                    ┌──────────┐                    │\n         │                    │ EXECUTE  │                    │\n         │                    │(Gateway) │                    │\n         │                    └────┬─────┘                    │\n         │                         │                          │\n         │  Spawn agents,          │   SDK-first execution,   │\n         │  stream output,         │   real-time monitoring,  │\n         │  manage lifecycle       │   checkpoints            │\n         │                         ▼                          │\n         │                    ┌──────────┐                    │\n         │                    │   SCAN   │                    │\n         │                    │  (UBS)   │                    │\n         │                    └────┬─────┘                    │\n         │                         │                          │\n         │  Quality gates,         │   Catch issues before    │\n         │  security checks,       │   they compound          │\n         │  anti-pattern detection │                          │\n         │                         ▼                          │\n         │                    ┌──────────┐                    │\n         └───────────────────▶│ REMEMBER │◀───────────────────┘\n                              │(CASS+CM) │\n                              └────┬─────┘\n                                   │\n            Index sessions,        │    Extract rules,\n            semantic search,       │    build playbooks,\n            find prior solutions   │    improve prompts\n                                   │\n                                   ▼\n                           ┌───────────────┐\n                           │ NEXT CYCLE    │\n                           │ IS BETTER     │\n                           └───────────────┘\n\n    Each revolution of the flywheel:\n    • Agents have more context (from CASS/CM)\n    • Work is better prioritized (from BV)\n    • Conflicts are prevented (from Agent Mail)\n    • Quality is maintained (from UBS)\n    • Execution is faster (from Gateway optimizations)\n```\n\nThe flywheel is **self-reinforcing**: each cycle generates knowledge that makes the next cycle faster and higher quality. Over time, the agents become more effective because they're building on accumulated intelligence rather than starting fresh each time.\n\n### The Flywheel Tools\n\nThe Agent Flywheel is implemented through interconnected tools organized into core orchestration components and developer utilities. Understanding each tool is essential to understanding this plan.\n\n#### 1. Flywheel Gateway (This Project)\n\n**What it is:** The orchestration backbone—a web platform that spawns, monitors, and coordinates AI coding agents.\n\n**Key responsibilities:**\n- Spawn agents via multiple backends (SDK, ACP protocol, Tmux terminals)\n- Stream agent output in real-time via WebSocket\n- Manage agent lifecycle (pause, resume, checkpoint, terminate)\n- Provide unified REST API for all flywheel tools\n- Host the web UI for human visibility and control\n- Manage BYOA accounts and rotate API keys when used (BYOK)\n- Build \"context packs\" that give agents situational awareness\n\n**Why it matters:** Without Gateway, agents are invisible black boxes. With Gateway, you have a command center showing what every agent is doing, with the ability to intervene when needed.\n\n#### 2. Agent Mail\n\n**What it is:** A messaging and coordination system for AI agents, implemented as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server.\n\n**Key responsibilities:**\n- **Messaging:** Agents send messages to each other (project updates, questions, handoffs)\n- **File Reservations:** Advisory locks that prevent edit conflicts (\"I'm working on auth.ts\")\n- **Thread Management:** Conversations are threaded for context preservation\n- **Project Identity:** Agents register under projects (working directory as identity)\n- **Contact Policies:** Control which agents can message which others\n\n**Key concepts:**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     AGENT MAIL ARCHITECTURE                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  PROJECT: /data/projects/my-app                                 │\n│  ├── Agent: GreenCastle (claude-code, opus-4.5)                │\n│  │   ├── Inbox: 3 unread messages                              │\n│  │   ├── Reservations: src/api/*.ts (exclusive, 2hr TTL)       │\n│  │   └── Status: Working on API refactor                       │\n│  │                                                              │\n│  ├── Agent: BlueLake (codex-cli, gpt-5)                        │\n│  │   ├── Inbox: 1 unread message                               │\n│  │   ├── Reservations: tests/*.test.ts (exclusive, 1hr TTL)    │\n│  │   └── Status: Writing test coverage                         │\n│  │                                                              │\n│  └── Agent: RedStone (claude-code, sonnet-4)                   │\n│      ├── Inbox: 0 unread messages                              │\n│      ├── Reservations: none                                     │\n│      └── Status: Idle, awaiting work                           │\n│                                                                 │\n│  THREADS:                                                       │\n│  ├── TKT-123: \"API Authentication Refactor\"                    │\n│  │   └── 12 messages, 3 participants                           │\n│  └── TKT-124: \"Fix login redirect bug\"                         │\n│      └── 5 messages, 2 participants                            │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without Agent Mail, agents step on each other's toes. With Agent Mail, they coordinate like a team—claiming work, signaling progress, and handing off context cleanly.\n\n#### 3. bd (Beads)\n\n**What it is:** An issue/task tracking system designed for AI-agent workflows. Think \"GitHub Issues but optimized for agents.\"\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Bead:** A unit of work (bug, feature, task, chore)\n- **Dependencies:** Beads can depend on other beads (forms a DAG)\n- **Status:** draft → ready → in_progress → review → done\n- **Metadata:** Priority, assignee (can be agent name), labels, time estimates\n\n**Why \"beads\"?** The metaphor is a string of beads—work items threaded together by dependencies, forming a necklace of progress.\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      BEADS DEPENDENCY GRAPH                      │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│    ┌─────────┐                                                  │\n│    │ BEADS-1 │ \"Set up database schema\"                        │\n│    │  DONE   │                                                  │\n│    └────┬────┘                                                  │\n│         │                                                       │\n│    ┌────┴────┐                                                  │\n│    ▼         ▼                                                  │\n│ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐                                        │\n│ │ BEADS-2 │ │ BEADS-3 │                                        │\n│ │  DONE   │ │IN_PROG  │ \"Implement user model\"                 │\n│ │         │ │BlueLake │                                        │\n│ └────┬────┘ └────┬────┘                                        │\n│      │           │                                              │\n│      └─────┬─────┘                                              │\n│            ▼                                                    │\n│      ┌─────────┐                                                │\n│      │ BEADS-4 │ \"Add authentication endpoints\"                │\n│      │  READY  │ ← GreenCastle can start this                  │\n│      └────┬────┘                                                │\n│           │                                                     │\n│           ▼                                                     │\n│      ┌─────────┐                                                │\n│      │ BEADS-5 │ \"Integration tests for auth\"                  │\n│      │ BLOCKED │ ← Waiting on BEADS-4                          │\n│      └─────────┘                                                │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without structured task tracking, agents don't know what to work on. With Beads, they can query for ready work, understand dependencies, and update status as they progress.\n\n#### 4. BV (Beads Visualization / Bead Voyager)\n\n**What it is:** A graph-aware triage and analysis engine that sits on top of Beads. It provides intelligent recommendations about what to work on next.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Graph Analysis:** PageRank, betweenness centrality, HITS algorithm to find critical-path items\n- **Triage Recommendations:** \"Here are the 5 most impactful beads to work on now\"\n- **Blocking Analysis:** \"These 3 beads are blocking the most other work\"\n- **Quick Wins:** \"These beads are small and unblock multiple items\"\n- **Robot Mode:** JSON output for programmatic consumption by agents\n\n**Example BV triage output:**\n```json\n{\n  \"recommendations\": [\n    {\n      \"bead_id\": \"BEADS-4\",\n      \"title\": \"Add authentication endpoints\",\n      \"score\": 0.92,\n      \"reasons\": [\n        \"Unblocks 3 downstream beads\",\n        \"High PageRank (critical path)\",\n        \"Estimated 2-4 hours (reasonable scope)\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"quick_wins\": [\n    {\n      \"bead_id\": \"BEADS-7\",\n      \"title\": \"Fix typo in error messages\",\n      \"score\": 0.78,\n      \"reasons\": [\"15 minutes\", \"No dependencies\", \"Improves UX\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"blockers_to_clear\": [\n    {\n      \"bead_id\": \"BEADS-3\",\n      \"blocking_count\": 4,\n      \"assignee\": \"BlueLake\",\n      \"status\": \"in_progress\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without BV, agents pick work randomly or by recency. With BV, they work on what matters most—maximizing throughput through the dependency graph.\n\n#### 5. UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)\n\n**What it is:** A code quality and security scanning tool that catches issues before they compound.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Static Analysis:** Detect common bugs, anti-patterns, security vulnerabilities\n- **Style Enforcement:** Ensure consistency across agent-written code\n- **Complexity Metrics:** Flag overly complex functions\n- **Security Scanning:** OWASP top 10, credential leaks, injection risks\n- **Integration:** Can auto-create Beads from findings\n\n**Scan categories:**\n| Category | Examples |\n|----------|----------|\n| **Security** | SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, insecure crypto |\n| **Quality** | Dead code, unused variables, unreachable branches |\n| **Complexity** | Functions > 50 lines, cyclomatic complexity > 10 |\n| **Style** | Inconsistent naming, missing error handling |\n| **Performance** | N+1 queries, unbounded loops, memory leaks |\n\n**Why it matters:** Agents write code fast, but they can introduce subtle bugs. UBS catches these before they accumulate into technical debt. It's the quality gate in the flywheel.\n\n#### 6. CASS (Cross-Agent Session Search)\n\n**What it is:** A semantic search engine that indexes past agent sessions, making historical knowledge discoverable.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Session Indexing:** Every agent conversation is indexed\n- **Semantic Search:** \"How did we handle OAuth last time?\" → relevant sessions\n- **Snippet Extraction:** Pull specific relevant portions, not entire sessions\n- **Filtering:** By date, agent, project, tags, outcome (success/failure)\n- **Privacy Controls:** Redact sensitive content before indexing\n\n**Example query:**\n```\nQuery: \"rate limiting implementation\"\n\nResults:\n1. Session 2024-12-15 (GreenCastle, my-api)\n   \"Implemented token bucket rate limiter in middleware...\"\n   Relevance: 0.94\n\n2. Session 2024-11-28 (BlueLake, auth-service)\n   \"Added sliding window rate limit with Redis backend...\"\n   Relevance: 0.87\n\n3. Session 2024-10-02 (RedStone, gateway)\n   \"Considered rate limiting approaches, chose leaky bucket...\"\n   Relevance: 0.71\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Without CASS, agents reinvent solutions. With CASS, they can search \"how did we solve X before?\" and build on prior work.\n\n#### 7. CM (Cass-Memory)\n\n**What it is:** A procedural memory system that extracts rules, patterns, and playbooks from CASS sessions.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Rule Extraction:** \"When doing X, always do Y\" patterns from successful sessions\n- **Anti-Pattern Detection:** \"This approach failed 3 times, avoid it\"\n- **Playbook Generation:** Step-by-step guides derived from successful sessions\n- **Context Retrieval:** \"For this task, here are relevant memories\"\n- **Privacy-Respecting:** Generalizes without exposing sensitive specifics\n\n**Example memories:**\n```yaml\n# Extracted from 47 sessions involving database migrations\n- rule: \"Always create a backup before running migrations\"\n  confidence: 0.95\n  source_sessions: 47\n\n- rule: \"Test migrations on a copy of production data\"\n  confidence: 0.89\n  source_sessions: 32\n\n- anti_pattern: \"Don't run migrations during peak traffic\"\n  failures: 3\n  description: \"Caused 2 outages when tried during business hours\"\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** CASS gives you search; CM gives you wisdom. It's the difference between \"here are past sessions\" and \"here's what we learned from them.\"\n\n#### 8. CAAM (Credential/Account Automation Manager)\n\n**What it is:** A system for managing **BYOA subscription accounts** (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) with optional BYOK (API key) support.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Profile Vault:** workspace‑local OAuth artifacts managed by CAAM (never centralized)\n- **Pool Management:** Multiple profiles per provider for rotation\n- **Auto‑Rotation:** When an account hits a limit, switch to the next profile\n- **Usage Tracking:** Track rate limits and cooldowns by profile\n- **Health Monitoring:** Detect expired tokens, rate limits, and auth failures\n\n**Example pool (profiles, not API keys):**\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                   CLAUDE MAX PROFILE POOL                        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│                                                                 │\n│  Profile: work@corp    │ Cooldown: 12m         │ Status: ACTIVE │\n│  Profile: alice@gmail  │ Cooldown: 0m          │ Status: READY  │\n│  Profile: bob@gmail    │ Cooldown: 43m         │ Status: COOLDOWN│\n│                                                                 │\n│  Current: work@corp (active)                                    │\n│  Next: alice@gmail (auto‑rotate on rate limit)                  │\n│                                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Agents consume API tokens fast. Without CAAM, you hit rate limits and stall. With CAAM, you have automatic failover across multiple keys and providers.\n\n#### 9. SLB (Safety Layer/Boundary)\n\n**What it is:** Safety guardrails that prevent dangerous operations and enforce human oversight for risky actions.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Two-Person Rule:** Dangerous operations require human approval\n- **Operation Classification:** Safe, risky, dangerous, forbidden\n- **Approval Workflows:** Request → Review → Approve/Deny\n- **Audit Trail:** Every approval decision is logged\n- **Timeout Handling:** Auto-deny if no response within window\n\n**Example dangerous operations:**\n| Operation | Risk Level | Requires |\n|-----------|------------|----------|\n| `rm -rf /` | FORBIDDEN | Blocked always |\n| `git push --force main` | DANGEROUS | Human approval |\n| `DROP TABLE users` | DANGEROUS | Human approval |\n| `git reset --hard` | RISKY | Warning + confirmation |\n| `npm install` | SAFE | Auto-approved |\n\n**Why it matters:** Autonomous agents are powerful but can make catastrophic mistakes. SLB ensures humans stay in the loop for irreversible actions.\n\n#### 10. RU (Repo Updater)\n\n**What it is:** A production-grade Bash CLI (~17,700 LOC) for managing large collections of GitHub repositories with AI-assisted review and agent automation capabilities.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Multi-repo sync:** Clone & pull 100+ repos with parallel processing (`-j N`)\n- **AI code review:** Orchestrates Claude Code sessions via ntm for PR/issue review\n- **Agent-sweep:** Three-phase automated workflow per repository (analyze → plan → execute)\n- **Conflict detection:** Identifies diverged, dirty, and conflicted repos with actionable resolution\n- **Preflight safety:** Blocks unsafe states (detached HEAD, merge in progress, secrets detected)\n\n**Agent-sweep workflow:**\n```\nPhase 1: Deep Understanding (300s)\n    ↓ Agent reads AGENTS.md, README.md, git log\nPhase 2: Plan Generation (600s)\n    ↓ Agent produces commit/release plans in structured JSON\nPhase 3: Validation & Execution (300s)\n    ↓ RU validates plans, runs preflight checks, executes git operations\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** Managing dozens of repositories manually is tedious and error-prone. RU automates sync, enables AI-driven maintenance across entire repository fleets, and integrates with ntm for session orchestration.\n\n#### 11. DCG (Destructive Command Guard)\n\n**What it is:** A high-performance Rust pre-execution hook (<1ms latency) for Claude Code that blocks catastrophic commands before they run.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Modular pack system:** git, filesystem, database, containers, kubernetes, cloud, terraform\n- **Context-aware:** Distinguishes executed code from data strings (dramatically reduces false positives)\n- **Severity tiers:** Critical (always block), High (allowlistable), Medium (warn), Low (log)\n- **Claude Code integration:** PreToolUse hook that intercepts Bash commands\n\n**Example blocked operations:**\n| Command | Pack | Severity |\n|---------|------|----------|\n| `git reset --hard` | core.git | Critical |\n| `rm -rf ./` | core.filesystem | Critical |\n| `docker system prune -af` | containers.docker | High |\n| `DROP DATABASE production` | database.postgresql | Critical |\n| `kubectl delete namespace prod` | kubernetes.kubectl | Critical |\n\n**Why it matters:** DCG is the mechanical enforcement layer that protects against honest mistakes. Unlike AGENTS.md instructions which agents might ignore, DCG physically prevents destructive commands from executing. It replaces simpler Python-based approaches with sub-millisecond Rust performance.\n\n#### Developer Utilities\n\nThese tools enhance AI agent workflows and should be auto-installed in agent environments:\n\n#### giil (Get Image from Internet Link)\n\n**What it is:** A zero-setup CLI that downloads full-resolution images from cloud photo sharing services.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **4-tier capture strategy:** Download button → CDN interception → element screenshot → viewport\n- **Supported platforms:** iCloud, Dropbox, Google Photos, Google Drive\n- **Image processing:** MozJPEG compression, EXIF datetime extraction, HEIC conversion\n- **Remote-friendly:** Perfect for SSH sessions where agents need to analyze screenshots\n\n**Why it matters:** When debugging UI issues remotely, agents need to see screenshots. giil bridges the gap—paste an iCloud link, run one command, agent immediately analyzes the image.\n\n#### csctf (Chat Shared Conversation to File)\n\n**What it is:** A single-binary CLI for converting public AI chat share links into clean Markdown and HTML transcripts.\n\n**Key capabilities:**\n- **Multi-provider:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude.ai\n- **Code-preserving:** Fenced blocks with language detection\n- **GitHub Pages:** One-command publish to static microsite\n- **Deterministic:** Collision-proof filenames, atomic writes\n\n**Why it matters:** AI conversations contain valuable problem-solving context. csctf captures this knowledge as searchable, archivable documents that can feed back into CASS for future retrieval.\n\n### How

All operations use CAAM for account profiles (BYOA) and API keys when needed (BYOK) → SLB for safety checks\n6. Gateway provides unified API for everything → Web UI visualizes it all\n```\n\n### The Flywheel in Action: An Example\n\nLet's walk through a concrete example of how the flywheel operates:\n\n**Scenario:** A team wants to add user authentication to their app. They have three AI agents available.\n\n```\nHOUR 0: Setup\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nHuman creates beads:\n  BEADS-1: \"Design auth schema\" (ready)\n  BEADS-2: \"Implement user model\" (depends on BEADS-1)\n  BEADS-3: \"Add login endpoint\" (depends on BEADS-2)\n  BEADS-4: \"Add registration endpoint\" (depends on BEADS-2)\n  BEADS-5: \"Write auth tests\" (depends on BEADS-3, BEADS-4)\n\nBV triage recommends: \"Start with BEADS-1, it unblocks everything\"\n\nHOUR 1: First Agent Starts\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nGreenCastle (Claude Opus 4.5):\n  1. Queries BV → gets BEADS-1 as top recommendation\n  2. Claims BEADS-1 via Agent Mail\n  3. Reserves db/schema.sql via Agent Mail\n  4. Gateway spawns agent with context pack:\n     - Task: BEADS-1 description\n     - Memory: \"Always use UUID for user IDs\" (from CM)\n     - Similar session: \"Auth schema from project-X\" (from CASS)\n  5. Completes work, marks BEADS-1 done\n  6. UBS scans changes → no issues found\n\nHOUR 2: Parallel Execution Begins\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBV updates: \"BEADS-2 is now ready and high priority\"\n\nBlueLake (Codex):\n  1. Queries BV → gets BEADS-2\n  2. Claims BEADS-2, reserves src/models/user.ts\n  3. Works on user model implementation\n\nGreenCastle (now idle):\n  1. Queries BV → no ready work yet (BEADS-3,4 depend on BEADS-2)\n  2. Messages BlueLake: \"Let me know when BEADS-2 is done\"\n  3. Waits or works on unrelated beads\n\nHOUR 3: Dependencies Resolve\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nBlueLake completes BEADS-2\n  → BV immediately updates: BEADS-3 and BEADS-4 are now ready\n  → Agent Mail notifies GreenCastle\n\nGreenCastle and RedStone (new agent):\n  1. GreenCastle claims BEADS-3 (login), reserves src/api/login.ts\n  2. RedStone claims BEADS-4 (registration), reserves src/api/register.ts\n  3. Both work in parallel—no conflicts because files are reserved\n\nHOUR 4: Quality Gate\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nGreenCastle completes BEADS-3\nRedStone completes BEADS-4\n\nUBS scans both:\n  - GreenCastle's code: ✅ Clean\n  - RedStone's code: ⚠️ \"SQL injection risk in email validation\"\n    → Auto-creates BEADS-6: \"Fix SQL injection in registration\"\n    → BEADS-5 now also depends on BEADS-6\n\nHOUR 5: Remediation and Completion\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nRedStone fixes BEADS-6 (quick win, 10 minutes)\nUBS re-scans: ✅ Clean\n\nBV: \"BEADS-5 (auth tests) is now ready\"\n\nBlueLake claims BEADS-5, writes comprehensive tests\nAll tests pass → Feature complete!\n\nHOUR 6: Knowledge Capture\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nCASS indexes all 5 sessions from this sprint\n\nCM extracts new rules:\n  - \"Use parameterized queries for email validation\"\n  - \"Include rate limiting on registration endpoints\"\n  - \"Auth schemas should include created_at/updated_at\"\n\nNext time any agent works on authentication:\n  → These rules appear in their context pack\n  → They don't repeat the SQL injection mistake\n  → The flywheel has improved\n```\n\n### The Philosophy: Why This Approach?\n\nSeveral philosophical principles guide the Agent Flywheel design:\n\n#### 1. Agents as First-Class Citizens\n\nTraditional tooling treats AI as an afterthought—\"maybe we'll add an API later.\" The flywheel treats agents as **primary users**:\n- Every operation has a REST API\n- OpenAPI specs include agent-specific hints\n- Error messages are designed to be actionable by agents\n- The system is observable and introspectable\n\n#### 2. Coordination Over Control\n\nRather than trying to \"control\" agents with rigid rules, we focus on **coordination**:\n- File reservations are advisory, not mandatory\n- Agents can message each other to resolve conflicts\n- The system provides information; agents make decisions\n\n#### 3. Memory as Infrastructure\n\nKnowledge shouldn't be trapped in individual sessions:\n- CASS makes all sessions searchable\n- CM extracts generalizable knowledge\n- Context packs deliver relevant memories at the right time\n- The system gets smarter with every session\n\n#### 4. Safety Through Visibility\n\nRather than trying to prevent all mistakes (impossible), we focus on:\n- Making agent activity visible (Gateway UI)\n- Catching issues early (UBS scanning)\n- Requiring approval for dangerous operations (SLB)\n- Maintaining audit trails for review\n\n#### 5. self-managed and Control\n\nThe flywheel is designed to run on your infrastructure:\n- No vendor lock-in; BYOA (Bring Your Own Account) with optional BYOK (API keys)\n- All data stays on your servers\n- Open protocols (MCP, ACP) for interoperability\n- Can run on cheap bare-metal (any VPS or dedicated server provider)\n\n### How to Read This Document\n\nThis plan document (PLAN.md) covers the **technical architecture** of Flywheel Gateway.\n\n**PLAN.md structure:**\n- §1-2: Vision, outcomes, philosophy\n- §3-4: Technology stack and architecture overview\n- §5-7: Core systems (supervisor, drivers, lifecycle)\n- §8-9: API and WebSocket layers\n- §10-21: Feature-by-feature specifications (each flywheel tool)\n- §22-23: UI/UX design\n- §24-26: Security, testing, risks\n- §27-30: Implementation phases and file structure\n- Appendix: API reference tables\n\n**Key terminology:**\n| Term | Meaning |\n|------|---------|\n| **Agent** | An AI coding assistant (Claude, Codex, Gemini, etc.) |\n| **Session** | A single conversation/task execution with an agent |\n| **Bead** | A unit of work (task, bug, feature) |\n| **Context Pack** | Pre-assembled prompt with triage, memory, search results |\n| **Driver** | Backend for agent execution (SDK, ACP, Tmux) |\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:56:50.147034625Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T01:50:10.161890877Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:56:55.185989264Z","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.1","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:16Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Agent Driver Abstraction\"** verbatim so Beads remains self-contained.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The embedded content below matches the corresponding section in `docs/PLAN.md`.\n\n## Embedded Content\n\n## 6. Agent Driver Abstraction\n\n### 6.1 The Driver Interface\n\nThe Agent Driver abstraction allows Flywheel Gateway to support multiple execution backends:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/agent-drivers/src/types.ts\n\ninterface AgentDriver {\n  readonly type: 'sdk' | 'acp' | 'tmux';\n\n  spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent>;\n  send(agentId: string, message: string): Promise<void>;\n  interrupt(agentId: string): Promise<void>;\n  getOutput(agentId: string, since?: Date): Promise<OutputLine[]>;\n  subscribe(agentId: string): AsyncIterable<AgentEvent>;\n  terminate(agentId: string): Promise<void>;\n\n  // Driver-specific capabilities\n  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities;\n}\n\ninterface AgentConfig {\n  model: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\n  workingDir: string;\n  systemPrompt?: string;\n  tools?: ToolConfig[];\n  agentMailIdentity?: string;\n}\n\ninterface Agent {\n  id: string;\n  driver: AgentDriver['type'];\n  config: AgentConfig;\n  status: 'spawning' | 'idle' | 'working' | 'error' | 'terminated';\n  createdAt: Date;\n  lastActivity: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AgentEvent {\n  type: 'output' | 'tool_call' | 'tool_result' | 'state_change' | 'error';\n  timestamp: Date;\n  agentId: string;\n  data: unknown;\n}\n\ninterface DriverCapabilities {\n  supportsStructuredEvents: boolean;\n  supportsToolCalls: boolean;\n  supportsFileOperations: boolean;\n  supportsTerminalAttach: boolean;\n  supportsDiffRendering: boolean;\n}\n```\n\n### 6.2 SDK Driver (Primary)\n\nThe SDK Driver uses agent SDKs directly for programmatic control:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/agent-drivers/src/sdk/driver.ts\n\nimport { ClaudeClient } from '@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk';\n\nexport class SDKDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly type = 'sdk' as const;\n\n  private claudeClient: ClaudeClient;\n  private agents = new Map<string, SDKAgent>();\n\n  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent> {\n    const client = this.getClientForModel(config.model);\n\n    const session = await client.createSession({\n      workingDirectory: config.workingDir,\n      systemPrompt: config.systemPrompt,\n    });\n\n    const agent: Agent = {\n      id: session.id,\n      driver: 'sdk',\n      config,\n      status: 'idle',\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n      lastActivity: new Date(),\n    };\n\n    this.agents.set(agent.id, { agent, session });\n    return agent;\n  }\n\n  async send(agentId: string, message: string): Promise<void> {\n    const { session } = this.agents.get(agentId)!;\n    await session.sendMessage(message);\n  }\n\n  async *subscribe(agentId: string): AsyncIterable<AgentEvent> {\n    const { session } = this.agents.get(agentId)!;\n\n    for await (const event of session.events()) {\n      yield this.mapSDKEvent(agentId, event);\n    }\n  }\n\n  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities {\n    return {\n      supportsStructuredEvents: true,\n      supportsToolCalls: true,\n      supportsFileOperations: true,\n      supportsTerminalAttach: false,\n      supportsDiffRendering: false,\n    };\n  }\n\n  private mapSDKEvent(agentId: string, event: SDKEvent): AgentEvent {\n    return {\n      type: this.mapEventType(event.type),\n      timestamp: new Date(),\n      agentId,\n      data: event.data,\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6.3 ACP Driver (Structured Events)\n\nThe ACP Driver implements the Agent Client Protocol for IDE-compatible structured events:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/agent-drivers/src/acp/driver.ts\n\nimport { spawn } from 'bun';\n\nexport class ACPDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly type = 'acp' as const;\n\n  private processes = new Map<string, ACPProcess>();\n\n  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent> {\n    // Spawn ACP-compatible agent via stdio\n    const proc = spawn({\n      cmd: this.getACPCommand(config.model),\n      stdin: 'pipe',\n      stdout: 'pipe',\n      stderr: 'pipe',\n      cwd: config.workingDir,\n    });\n\n    const agent: Agent = {\n      id: crypto.randomUUID(),\n      driver: 'acp',\n      config,\n      status: 'idle',\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n      lastActivity: new Date(),\n    };\n\n    this.processes.set(agent.id, { agent, proc, rpc: new JSONRPCClient(proc) });\n    return agent;\n  }\n\n  async send(agentId: string, message: string): Promise<void> {\n    const { rpc } = this.processes.get(agentId)!;\n    await rpc.call('agent/send', { message });\n  }\n\n  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities {\n    return {\n      supportsStructuredEvents: true,\n      supportsToolCalls: true,\n      supportsFileOperations: true,\n      supportsTerminalAttach: false,\n      supportsDiffRendering: true,  // ACP has diff rendering types\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6.4 Tmux Driver (Fallback)\n\nThe Tmux Driver supports users who want visual terminal access:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/agent-drivers/src/tmux/driver.ts\n\nexport class TmuxDriver implements AgentDriver {\n  readonly type = 'tmux' as const;\n\n  async spawn(config: AgentConfig): Promise<Agent> {\n    const sessionName = `flywheel-${Date.now()}`;\n\n    // Create tmux session\n    await $`tmux new-session -d -s ${sessionName} -c ${config.workingDir}`;\n\n    // Start the appropriate CLI in the pane\n    const cmd = this.getCLICommand(config.model);\n    await $`tmux send-keys -t ${sessionName} ${cmd} Enter`;\n\n    const agent: Agent = {\n      id: sessionName,\n      driver: 'tmux',\n      config,\n      status: 'idle',\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n      lastActivity: new Date(),\n    };\n\n    return agent;\n  }\n\n  getCapabilities(): DriverCapabilities {\n    return {\n      supportsStructuredEvents: false,  // Text parsing only\n      supportsToolCalls: false,\n      supportsFileOperations: false,\n      supportsTerminalAttach: true,     // Can attach visual terminal\n      supportsDiffRendering: false,\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 6.5 Driver Selection Strategy\n\n```typescript\n// packages/agent-drivers/src/index.ts\n\nexport function selectDriver(\n  preference: 'sdk' | 'acp' | 'tmux' | 'auto',\n  config: AgentConfig\n): AgentDriver {\n  if (preference === 'auto') {\n    // SDK is preferred for programmatic control\n    if (hasSDKSupport(config.model)) return new SDKDriver();\n    // ACP for structured events without full SDK\n    if (hasACPAdapter(config.model)) return new ACPDriver();\n    // Tmux as fallback\n    return new TmuxDriver();\n  }\n\n  switch (preference) {\n    case 'sdk': return new SDKDriver();\n    case 'acp': return new ACPDriver();\n    case 'tmux': return new TmuxDriver();\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:35.690835058Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:40.728629641Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:40.728629641Z","close_reason":"Embedded

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.11","title":"PLAN: 7. Agent Lifecycle Management","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead embeds the `docs/PLAN.md` section **\"7. Agent Lifecycle Management\"** verbatim so Beads remains self-contained.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The embedded content below matches the corresponding section in `docs/PLAN.md`.\n\n## Embedded Content\n\n## 7. Agent Lifecycle Management\n\n### 7.1 Activity States\n\n```typescript\ntype ActivityState =\n  | 'idle'           // Waiting for input\n  | 'thinking'       // Processing, no output yet\n  | 'working'        // Actively producing output\n  | 'tool_calling'   // Executing a tool\n  | 'waiting_input'  // Waiting for user input\n  | 'error'          // Encountered an error\n  | 'stalled';       // No activity for threshold period\n\ninterface ActivityStatus {\n  agentId: string;\n  state: ActivityState;\n  since: Date;\n  duration: number;  // ms in current state\n  lastOutput?: Date;\n  lastToolCall?: {\n    name: string;\n    startedAt: Date;\n  };\n  healthScore: number;  // 0-100\n}\n```\n\n### 7.2 Activity Detection (SDK Driver)\n\nFor SDK-based agents, activity detection is straightforward via events:\n\n```typescript\nclass SDKActivityDetector {\n  detectState(events: AgentEvent[]): ActivityState {\n    const recent = events.slice(-10);\n\n    if (recent.some(e => e.type === 'error')) {\n      return 'error';\n    }\n\n    if (recent.some(e => e.type === 'tool_call' && !e.completed)) {\n      return 'tool_calling';\n    }\n\n    const lastOutput = recent.findLast(e => e.type === 'output');\n    if (lastOutput && Date.now() - lastOutput.timestamp.getTime() < 5000) {\n      return 'working';\n    }\n\n    const lastActivity = recent[recent.length - 1];\n    if (lastActivity && Date.now() - lastActivity.timestamp.getTime() > 5 * 60 * 1000) {\n      return 'stalled';\n    }\n\n    return 'idle';\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 7.3 Checkpoints\n\nAgents can go off-track. Checkpoints allow rolling back to a known-good state.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Checkpoint {\n  id: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  name?: string;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  createdBy: 'user' | 'auto' | 'agent';\n  trigger: 'manual' | 'scheduled' | 'before_risky_op' | 'milestone';\n\n  // Captured state\n  conversationHistory: Message[];\n  toolState: Record<string, unknown>;\n  workingDirectory: string;\n  fileSnapshot: FileSnapshot[];  // Modified files since session start\n  contextPack?: ContextPack;\n\n  // Metadata\n  description?: string;\n  tags: string[];\n  size: number;  // bytes\n  verified: boolean;\n  verifiedAt?: Date;\n\n  // Delta chain metadata (for progressive checkpointing)\n  checkpointType: 'full' | 'delta';\n  parentId?: string;           // For delta checkpoints\n  deltaDepth?: number;         // How many deltas to traverse\n  fullCheckpointId?: string;   // Nearest full checkpoint in chain\n}\n\ninterface FileSnapshot {\n  path: string;\n  content: string;\n  hash: string;\n  mtime: Date;\n}\n```\n\n#### 7.3.1 Delta-Based Progressive Checkpointing\n\nInstead of full snapshots for each checkpoint, store only what changed since the last checkpoint—dramatically reducing storage costs and restore times.\n\n**The Problem with Full Checkpoints:**\n\nFor a 2-hour agent session with 50 modified files, each checkpoint could be 10-50MB.

This requires more than just messaging—it requires a structured transfer of context, state, and resources.\n\n**The Problem Without Structured Handoffs:**\n1. Agent A finishes part 1 and updates a bead\n2. Human notices\n3. Human spawns Agent B\n4. Human crafts a prompt explaining the context (often incomplete)\n\n**With the Handoff Protocol:**\n1. Agent A initiates handoff: \"Hey BlueLake, I've completed the API schema. Your turn for frontend integration.\"\n2. BlueLake automatically receives: task context, relevant conversation history, modified files, and continuation prompt\n3. Work continues seamlessly\n\n#### 7.8.1 Handoff Data Model\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/handoff.ts\n\ninterface HandoffRequest {\n  id: string;\n  from: AgentIdentity;\n  to: AgentIdentity | 'any';  // 'any' for pool-based assignment\n\n  // What's being handed off\n  task: {\n    beadId?: string;\n    description: string;\n    completedWork: string;      // Summary of what was done\n    remainingWork: string;      // What the receiver should do\n    priority: number;\n  };\n\n  // Context transfer\n  context: {\n    relevantFiles: string[];           // Files the receiver should read\n    modifiedFiles: string[];           // Files that were changed\n    keyDecisions: string[];            // Important choices made\n    conversationSummary: string;       // Condensed history\n    openQuestions: string[];           // Unresolved issues\n  };\n\n  // Resource transfer\n  resources: {\n    reservationsToTransfer: string[];  // File reservations to pass\n    checkpointId?: string;             // Checkpoint for fallback\n    contextPackId?: string;            // Pre-built context pack\n  };\n\n  // Handoff metadata\n  status: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'completed' | 'expired';\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n  acceptedAt?: Date;\n  completedAt?: Date;\n  rejectionReason?: string;\n}\n\ninterface HandoffAcceptance {\n  handoffId: string;\n  agentId: string;\n  acknowledgedContext: boolean;\n  modifiedRemainingWork?: string;  // Agent can clarify/modify\n}\n```\n\n#### 7.8.2 Handoff Service\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/services/handoff.service.ts\n\nexport class HandoffService {\n  constructor(\n    private agentService: AgentService,\n    private mailService: AgentMailService,\n    private reservationService: FileReservationService,\n    private contextService: ContextService,\n    private checkpointService: CheckpointService,\n    private beadService: BeadService,\n  ) {}\n\n  async initiateHandoff(request: HandoffRequest): Promise<HandoffResult> {\n    // 1.

Without idempotency, this could spawn duplicate agents, send duplicate prompts, or create duplicate checkpoints.\n\n**Idempotency Header:**\nFor any POST that mutates state, accept:\n- `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` header\n- Server stores key + result for a TTL window\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/middleware/idempotency.ts\n\nconst idempotencyStore = new Map<string, StoredResult>();\n\ninterface StoredResult {\n  response: unknown;\n  statusCode: number;\n  createdAt: Date;\n  expiresAt: Date;\n}\n\nexport async function idempotencyMiddleware(c: Context, next: Next) {\n  const idempotencyKey = c.req.header('Idempotency-Key');\n\n  if (!idempotencyKey) {\n    return next();\n  }\n\n  // Check for existing result\n  const existing = idempotencyStore.get(idempotencyKey);\n  if (existing && existing.expiresAt > new Date()) {\n    return c.json(existing.response, existing.statusCode);\n  }\n\n  // Execute and store\n  await next();\n\n  const response = await c.res.json();\n  idempotencyStore.set(idempotencyKey, {\n    response,\n    statusCode: c.res.status,\n    createdAt: new Date(),\n    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24h TTL\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 8.4.1 Provisioning API (Queue‑Driven)\n\nProvisioning is a first‑class REST resource. All state changes flow through the queue API.\n\n**Create request:**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests\nIdempotency-Key: <uuid>\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"workspace_id\": \"workspace-abc123\",\n  \"capacity_profile_id\": \"profile-standard\",\n  \"provider_id\": \"provider-a\",\n  \"region\": \"eu-central\",\n  \"email_verified_at\": \"2026-01-08T00:00:00Z\",\n  \"onboarding_mode\": \"manual\"\n}\n```\n\n**Response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"id\": \"prov_01HXYZ\",\n    \"state\": \"pending\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2026-01-08T00:00:00Z\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Transition request (explicit from/to):**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests/{id}/transition\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"from\": \"approved\",\n  \"to\": \"provisioned\",\n  \"reason\": \"manual_approval_complete\"\n}\n```\n\n**Allowed transitions:**\n- `pending → approved`\n- `approved → provisioned`\n- `provisioned → verified`\n- `verified → assigned`\n- Any state → `failed` (with reason)\n- `pending/approved` → `expired`\n- `failed` → `pending` (retry)\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- `pending → approved` requires `email_verified_at`.\n- `pending → approved` requires manual approval when `onboarding_mode=manual`.\n\n**Verification report:**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests/{id}/verify\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"checks\": {\n    \"disk_io\": \"pass\",\n    \"network_latency_ms\": 18,\n    \"container_health\": \"pass\",\n    \"monitoring_agent\": \"pass\",\n    \"caam_ready\": \"pass\"\n  },\n  \"notes\": \"Initial verification complete\"\n}\n```\n\n**Assignment (BYOA gated):**\n```http\nPOST /provisioning/requests/{id}/assign\n```\n```json\n{\n  \"requires_byoa\": true,\n  \"min_providers\": 1\n}\n```\n\nIf BYOA is not verified, the API returns `BYOA_REQUIRED`.\n\n### 8.5 Error Model & Taxonomy\n\nAll errors follow a consistent structure with semantic error codes and HTTP status mappings:\n\n```typescript\ninterface ApiError {\n  error: {\n    code: ErrorCode;                    // Semantic error code\n    message: string;                    // Human-readable description\n    details?: Record<string, unknown>;  // Additional context\n    request_id: string;                 // For support/debugging\n    hint?: string;                      // Suggested fix for AI agents\n    docs_url?: string;                  // Link to relevant documentation\n  };\n}\n```\n\n#### Error Code Taxonomy\n\nErrors are organized into categories with consistent HTTP status mappings:\n\n| Category | Code Pattern | HTTP Status | Description |\n|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| **Resource** | `*_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Resource doesn't exist |\n| **Resource** | `*_ALREADY_EXISTS` | 409 | Resource already exists |\n| **Validation** | `INVALID_*` | 400 | Request validation failed |\n| **Validation** | `MISSING_*` | 400 | Required field missing |\n| **Auth** | `UNAUTHORIZED` | 401 | Not authenticated |\n| **Auth** | `FORBIDDEN` | 403 | Not authorized for action |\n| **Quota** | `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` | 429 | Rate/usage limit hit |\n| **Quota** | `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests |\n| **State** | `*_IN_PROGRESS` | 409 | Conflicting operation |\n| **State** | `*_NOT_READY` | 503 | Resource not ready |\n| **Dependency** | `*_UNAVAILABLE` | 503 | Dependency down |\n| **Internal** | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error |\n\n#### Complete Error Code Reference\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/errors/codes.ts\n\nexport const ErrorCodes = {\n  // Agent errors\n  AGENT_NOT_FOUND: { status:

These return a job ID immediately, with status polling.\n\n```typescript\ninterface Job {\n  id: string;\n  type: string;\n  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';\n  progress?: number;  // 0-100\n  createdAt: Date;\n  startedAt?: Date;\n  completedAt?: Date;\n  result?: unknown;\n  error?: string;\n  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;\n}\n```\n\n**Jobs REST Endpoints:**\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/jobs` | List jobs |\n| `GET` | `/jobs/{id}` | Get job status |\n| `DELETE` | `/jobs/{id}` | Cancel job |\n| `GET` | `/jobs/{id}/result` | Get job result |\n\n**Jobs WebSocket Events:**\n\n```typescript\ninterface JobEvent {\n  type: 'job.started' | 'job.progress' | 'job.completed' | 'job.failed';\n  data: {\n    jobId: string;\n    status: Job['status'];\n    progress?: number;\n    result?: unknown;\n    error?: string;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 8.8 OpenAPI & Developer Experience\n\nThe API is self-documenting for both humans and AI agents.\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/openapi/generator.ts\n\nimport { generateOpenApi } from '@hono/zod-openapi';\n\nexport const openApiSpec = generateOpenApi(app, {\n  openapi: '3.1.0',\n  info: {\n    title: 'Flywheel Gateway API',\n    version: '1.0.0',\n    description: 'Multi-agent orchestration platform API',\n  },\n  servers: [\n    { url: 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1', description: 'Development' },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n**AI-Agent Hints:**\n\nEvery endpoint includes hints for AI consumers:\n\n```typescript\ninterface EndpointHints {\n  summary: string;              // What this does\n  whenToUse: string;           // When an agent should call this\n  commonMistakes: string[];    // What to avoid\n  relatedEndpoints: string[];  // What to call next\n  exampleScenarios: string[];  // Real use cases\n}\n```\n\n**Swagger UI:** Available at `/docs` with interactive testing, request/response examples, authentication helper, and WebSocket documentation.\n\n### 8.9 Core Endpoint Categories\n\n#### System (`/api/v1/...`)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/health` | Health check |\n| `GET` | `/version` | Version info |\n| `GET` | `/capabilities` | Available features |\n| `GET` | `/doctor` | Tool health check |\n\n#### Agents (`/api/v1/agents`)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/agents` | List all agents |\n| `POST` | `/agents` | Spawn new agent |\n| `GET` | `/agents/{id}` | Get agent details |\n| `DELETE` | `/agents/{id}` | Terminate agent |\n| `POST` | `/agents/{id}/send` | Send prompt |\n| `POST` | `/agents/{id}/interrupt` | Interrupt agent |\n| `GET` | `/agents/{id}/output` | Get output |\n| `GET` | `/agents/{id}/status` | Get status |\n| `POST` | `/agents/{id}/checkpoint` | Create checkpoint |\n\n### 8.10 Golden Path: API Sequence for AI Agents\n\nThis section demonstrates the **ideal API call sequence** for an AI agent orchestrating work. Agents consuming the OpenAPI spec should follow this pattern for reliable operation.\n\n#### Scenario: Spawn Agent, Coordinate, Execute Task\n\n```typescript\n// Step 1: Check system health and capabilities\nconst capabilities = await fetch('/api/v1/capabilities').then(r => r.json());\n// → Verify required features are available\n\n// Step 2: Check for ready work (if using Beads)\nconst triage = await fetch('/api/v1/beads/triage').then(r => r.json());\n// → Get prioritized recommendations: triage.data.recommendations\n\n// Step 3: Claim work to prevent conflicts\nconst bead = await fetch('/api/v1/beads/beads-123', {\n  method: 'PATCH',\n  body: JSON.stringify({ status: 'in_progress', assignee: 'GreenCastle' }),\n}).then(r => r.json());\n\n// Step 4: Reserve files before starting work\nconst reservation = await fetch('/api/v1/reservations', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    paths: ['src/api/users.ts', 'src/api/users.test.ts'],\n    agent: 'GreenCastle',\n    exclusive: true,\n    ttl_seconds: 3600,\n  }),\n}).then(r => r.json());\n\n// Check for conflicts\nif (reservation.data.conflicts.length > 0) {\n  // Coordinate via Agent Mail or wait\n  console.log('Conflict with:', reservation.data.conflicts[0].holder);\n}\n\n// Step 5: Build context pack for the task\nconst contextPack = await fetch('/api/v1/context/build', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    taskDescription: bead.data.title,\n    components: {\n      triage: { budget: 2000, enabled: true },\n      memory: { budget: 3000, enabled: true },\n      cass: { budget: 2000, enabled: true },\n    },\n  }),\n}).then(r => r.json());\n\n// Step 6: Spawn the agent\nconst agent = await fetch('/api/v1/agents', {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    model: 'claude',\n    workingDir: '/path/to/project',\n    contextPack: contextPack.data.id,\n  }),\n}).then(r => r.json());\n\n// Step 7: Subscribe to output via WebSocket\nconst ws = new WebSocket('/api/v1/ws');\nws.send(JSON.stringify({\n  op: 'subscribe',\n  topics: [`output:${agent.data.id}`, `agents:${agent.data.id}`],\n}));\n\n// Step 8: Send the task prompt\nawait fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}/send`, {\n  method: 'POST',\n  body: JSON.stringify({\n    prompt: `Complete this task: ${bead.data.title}\\n\\n${bead.data.description}`,\n  }),\n});\n\n// Step 9: Monitor for completion (via WebSocket events)\nws.onmessage = (event) => {\n  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);\n  if (msg.type === 'agent.state_changed' && msg.data.state === 'idle') {\n    // Agent finished\n    handleCompletion();\n  }\n};\n\n// Step 10: On completion, create checkpoint and release resources\nasync function handleCompletion() {\n  // Create checkpoint before cleanup\n  await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}/checkpoint`, {\n    method: 'POST',\n    body: JSON.stringify({ reason: 'task_complete' }),\n  });\n\n  // Release file reservations\n  await fetch('/api/v1/reservations', {\n    method: 'DELETE',\n    body: JSON.stringify({ agent: 'GreenCastle' }),\n  });\n\n  // Close the bead\n  await fetch('/api/v1/beads/beads-123/close', { method: 'POST' });\n\n  // Terminate agent (or keep for next task)\n  await fetch(`/api/v1/agents/${agent.data.id}`, { method: 'DELETE' });\n}\n```\n\n#### Error Handling Pattern\n\n```typescript\nasync function safeApiCall<T>(\n  url: string,\n  options?: RequestInit\n): Promise<{ data?: T; error?: ApiError }> {\n  const response = await fetch(url, options);\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const error = await response.json();\n\n    // Handle specific recoverable errors\n    switch (error.error.code) {\n      case 'QUOTA_EXCEEDED':\n        // Rotate to different account and retry\n        await fetch('/api/v1/accounts/pools/default/rotate', { method: 'POST' });\n        return safeApiCall(url, options);\n\n      case 'RESERVATION_CONFLICT':\n        // Wait and retry, or coordinate via mail\n        await sleep(30000);\n        return safeApiCall(url, options);\n\n      case 'AGENT_BUSY':\n        // Wait for agent to finish current operation\n        await sleep(5000);\n        return safeApiCall(url, options);\n\n      default:\n        return { error: error.error };\n    }\n  }\n\n  return { data: (await response.json()).data };\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Principles for Agent Consumers\n\n1. **Always check capabilities first** — Don't assume features exist\n2. **Reserve before editing** — Prevent file conflicts\n3. **Use context packs** — Give agents situational awareness\n4. **Subscribe to WebSocket early** — Don't miss events\n5. **Create checkpoints** — Enable recovery on failure\n6. **Clean up resources** — Release reservations, close beads\n7. **Handle errors gracefully** — Many errors are recoverable\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:50.879506316Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T01:50:15.197084031Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:55.914622363Z","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.13","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:16Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Clients need to automatically reconnect and resume without missing events.\n\n**Cursor-Based Resume:**\n\n```typescript\n// Client sends on reconnect\n{\n  \"op\": \"subscribe\",\n  \"topics\": [\"agents:abc123\", \"output:abc123\"],\n  \"since\": {\n    \"cursor\": \"cursor_01H...\",\n    // OR\n    \"seq\": 185000\n  }\n}\n\n// Server responds\n{\n  \"op\": \"subscribed\",\n  \"resumedFrom\": \"cursor_01H...\",\n  \"missedEvents\": 42,  // How many events were buffered\n  \"bufferOverflow\": false  // If true, some events were lost\n}\n```\n\n**Snapshot-on-Connect (when buffer overflow):**\n\n```typescript\n// Server sends\n{\n  \"type\": \"stream.reset\",\n  \"topic\": \"output:abc123\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"reason\": \"cursor_expired\",\n    \"snapshot\": {\n      \"lines\": [\"...last 200 lines...\"],\n      \"currentSeq\": 186000\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Client Implementation:**\n\n```typescript\n// apps/web/src/lib/ws.ts\n\nexport class ReconnectingWebSocket {\n  private ws: WebSocket | null = null;\n  private lastSeq = new Map<string, number>();\n  private reconnectAttempts = 0;\n  private maxReconnectAttempts = 10;\n  private reconnectDelay = 1000;\n\n  connect() {\n    this.ws = new WebSocket(this.url);\n\n    this.ws.onopen = () => {\n      this.reconnectAttempts = 0;\n      this.resubscribe();\n    };\n\n    this.ws.onclose = () => {\n      this.scheduleReconnect();\n    };\n\n    this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {\n      const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);\n      if (msg.seq) {\n        this.lastSeq.set(msg.topic, msg.seq);\n      }\n      this.emit('message', msg);\n    };\n  }\n\n  private resubscribe() {\n    for (const [topic, seq] of this.lastSeq) {\n      this.send({\n        op: 'subscribe',\n        topics: [topic],\n        since: { seq },\n      });\n    }\n  }\n\n  private scheduleReconnect() {\n    if (this.reconnectAttempts >= this.maxReconnectAttempts) {\n      this.emit('maxReconnectAttemptsReached');\n      return;\n    }\n\n    const delay = this.reconnectDelay * Math.pow(2, this.reconnectAttempts);\n    this.reconnectAttempts++;\n\n    setTimeout(() => this.connect(), delay);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9.7 Backpressure & Performance\n\nFor high-throughput agents, output can exceed what a browser can render.\n\n**Server-side:**\n- Per-agent ring buffer (configurable, default 10000 lines)\n- Per-client subscription limits\n\n**Client options:**\n```json\n{\n  \"op\": \"subscribe\",\n  \"topics\": [\"output:abc123\"],\n  \"options\": {\n    \"mode\": \"lines\",       // \"lines\" (safe) or \"raw\" (fast)\n    \"throttle_ms\": 100,    // Batch updates\n    \"max_lines_per_msg\": 50\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9.8 Reliability & Acknowledgment Protocol\n\nFor mission-critical events (approvals, conflicts, errors), the WebSocket layer provides guaranteed delivery with acknowledgments.\n\n#### Sequence Numbers & Resume\n\nEvery event has a monotonically increasing sequence number per topic:\n\n```typescript\ninterface ReliableEvent {\n  seq: number;           // Monotonic per topic\n  ts: string;            // ISO-8601 timestamp\n  topic: string;\n  type: string;\n  data: unknown;\n  requires_ack?: boolean; // Client must acknowledge\n}\n```\n\n**Resume from last seen:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"op\": \"subscribe\",\n  \"topics\": [\"alerts\", \"approvals\"],\n  \"since\": { \"alerts\": 1234, \"approvals\": 567 }\n}\n```\n\nThe server replays any events with `seq > since[topic]` before streaming live events.\n\n#### Acknowledgment Protocol\n\nCritical events (marked with `requires_ack: true`) must be acknowledged:\n\n```typescript\n// Server sends critical event\n{\n  \"seq\": 1235,\n  \"topic\": \"approvals\",\n  \"type\": \"approval.requested\",\n  \"requires_ack\": true,\n  \"ack_deadline_ms\": 30000,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"approval_id\": \"apr_123\",\n    \"action\": \"git push --force\",\n    \"risk_level\": \"dangerous\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Client must respond within deadline\n{\n  \"op\": \"ack\",\n  \"topic\": \"approvals\",\n  \"seq\": 1235\n}\n```\n\nIf not acknowledged within deadline, the server:\n1. Logs a delivery failure\n2. Retries delivery up to 3 times\n3. Falls back to alternative notification (email, webhook)\n\n#### Missed Message Detection\n\nClients detect gaps in sequence numbers:\n\n```typescript\nclass ReliableWebSocket {\n  private lastSeq = new Map<string, number>();\n\n  handleMessage(event: ReliableEvent) {\n    const lastSeen = this.lastSeq.get(event.topic) ?? 0;\n\n    if (event.seq > lastSeen + 1) {\n      // Gap detected - request replay\n      this.ws.send(JSON.stringify({\n        op: 'replay',\n        topic: event.topic,\n        from_seq: lastSeen + 1,\n        to_seq: event.seq - 1,\n      }));\n    }\n\n    this.lastSeq.set(event.topic, event.seq);\n    this.processEvent(event);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 9.9 Scale-Out Architecture\n\nFor high-availability deployments with multiple gateway instances, WebSocket connections are distributed across servers with shared state.\n\n#### Redis Adapter Pattern\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/ws/redis-adapter.ts\n\nimport { Redis } from 'ioredis';\n\ninterface ScaleOutConfig {\n  mode: 'single' | 'redis' | 'cluster';\n  redis?: {\n    url: string;\n    keyPrefix: string;\n  };\n}\n\nexport class RedisWebSocketAdapter {\n  private pub: Redis;\n  private sub: Redis;\n\n  constructor(private config: ScaleOutConfig) {\n    if (config.mode === 'redis') {\n      this.pub = new Redis(config.redis!.url);\n      this.sub = new Redis(config.redis!.url);\n      this.setupSubscriptions();\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Broadcast to all servers\n  async broadcast(topic: string, event: WebSocketEvent): Promise<void> {\n    if (this.config.mode === 'single') {\n      // Direct broadcast to local connections\n      this.localHub.broadcast(topic, event);\n    } else {\n      // Publish to Redis, all servers receive and broadcast locally\n      await this.pub.publish(\n        `${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:${topic}`,\n        JSON.stringify(event)\n      );\n    }\n  }\n\n  private setupSubscriptions() {\n    this.sub.psubscribe(`${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:*`);\n\n    this.sub.on('pmessage', (pattern, channel, message) => {\n      const topic = channel.replace(`${this.config.redis!.keyPrefix}:`, '');\n      const event = JSON.parse(message);\n      this.localHub.broadcast(topic, event);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Sticky Sessions\n\nFor WebSocket connections, use sticky sessions to route reconnecting clients to the same server:\n\n```typescript\n// Connection ID encodes server affinity\ninterface ConnectionId {\n  serverId: string;    // e.g., 'gateway-1'\n  connectionId: string; // UUID\n  createdAt: number;\n}\n\n// Load balancer uses X-Server-Id header for routing\nfunction generateConnectionId(serverId: string): string {\n  return Buffer.from(JSON.stringify({\n    serverId,\n    connectionId: crypto.randomUUID(),\n    createdAt: Date.now(),\n  })).toString('base64url');\n}\n```\n\n#### Horizontal Scaling Topology\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                       LOAD BALANCER                                  │\n│                  (Sticky sessions by connection ID)                  │\n└───────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n                            │\n        ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐\n        │                   │                   │\n        ▼                   ▼                   ▼\n┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐   ┌───────────────┐\n│  Gateway 1    │   │  Gateway 2    │   │  Gateway 3    │\n│  (WebSocket)  │   │  (WebSocket)  │   │  (WebSocket)  │\n└───────┬───────┘   └───────┬───────┘   └───────┬───────┘\n        │                   │                   │\n        └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘\n                            │\n                    ┌───────▼───────┐\n                    │    Redis      │\n                    │  (Pub/Sub)    │\n                    └───────────────┘\n                            │\n                    ┌───────▼───────┐\n                    │   SQLite /    │\n                    │   Postgres    │\n                    └───────────────┘\n```\n\n**Scaling Guidelines:**\n\n| Metric | Single Server | Redis Mode | Notes |\n|--------|---------------|------------|-------|\n| Connections | ~10,000 | ~100,000+ | Per gateway instance |\n| Events/sec | ~50,000 | ~500,000 | Aggregate across cluster |\n| Latency | <10ms | <50ms | Pub/sub adds overhead |\n| Complexity | Low | Medium | Redis operational burden |\n\n**Recommendation:** Start with single-server mode.

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.21","title":"PLAN: 16. CAAM Account & Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)","description":"## Overview\n\nThis bead embeds the `docs/PLAN.md` section **\"16. CAAM Account & Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)\"** verbatim so Beads remains self-contained.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] The embedded content below matches the corresponding section in `docs/PLAN.md`.\n\n## Embedded Content\n\n## 16. CAAM Account & Profile Management (BYOA + BYOK)\n\nCAAM (Coding Agent Account Manager) is the **account/profile orchestration layer** for Flywheel Gateway. It is designed for **BYOA (Bring Your Own Account)** subscription logins by default, with optional **BYOK (API key)** support for advanced automation use cases.\n\n**Non‑negotiable security invariant:** OAuth credentials are never stored in Gateway’s central database. All auth artifacts live inside each workspace's isolated environment, managed by CAAM. Gateway only stores **non‑sensitive metadata** (presence, hashes, timestamps, health).\n\n### 16.1 Principles\n\n1. **BYOA first** — subscription accounts (Claude Max, GPT Pro, Gemini) are the default path.\n2. **No credential custody** — Gateway never sees Google/Anthropic/OpenAI logins or passwords.\n3. **workspace‑local auth artifacts** — tokens remain inside the workspace container/volume.\n4. **Minimum requirement** — at least one verified provider to activate/assign; recommended: 1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro.\n5. **Provider parity** — Claude, Codex, and Gemini are all supported.\n6. **Autonomous rotation** — cooldown + rotation is automated via CAAM.\n\n### 16.2 Account & Profile Data Model\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/accounts.ts\n\ntype ProviderId = 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\ntype AuthMode = 'oauth_browser' | 'device_code' | 'api_key';\n\ninterface AccountProfile {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  name: string;               // Profile label (e.g., \"work\", \"alice@gmail.com\")\n  authMode: AuthMode;\n\n  // Status & health (no secrets)\n  status: 'unlinked' | 'linked' | 'verified' | 'expired' | 'cooldown' | 'error';\n  statusMessage?: string;\n  lastVerifiedAt?: Date;\n  expiresAt?: Date;           // If known from token metadata\n  cooldownUntil?: Date;\n  lastUsedAt?: Date;\n  healthScore?: number;       // 0..100\n\n  // Auth artifacts (metadata only)\n  artifacts: {\n    authFilesPresent: boolean;\n    authFileHash?: string;    // hash of auth artifact for change detection\n    storageMode?: 'file' | 'keyring' | 'unknown';\n  };\n\n  labels?: string[];\n  createdAt: Date;\n  updatedAt: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AccountPool {\n  id: string;\n  workspaceId: string;\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  profileIds: string[];\n  rotationStrategy: 'smart' | 'round_robin' | 'least_recent' | 'random';\n  cooldownMinutesDefault: number;\n  maxRetries: number;\n}\n\ninterface workspaceAuthState {\n  workspaceId: string;\n  byoaStatus: 'unlinked' | 'pending' | 'verified' | 'failed';\n  verifiedProviders: ProviderId[];\n  lastCheckedAt?: Date;\n}\n```\n\n### 16.3 CAAM Integration Architecture\n\nCAAM runs **inside each workspace container**. Gateway interacts with it via a thin runner interface:\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/caam/runner.ts\n\ninterface LoginChallenge {\n  provider: ProviderId;\n  mode: 'device_code' | 'oauth_url' | 'local_browser' | 'manual_copy';\n  code?: string;              // For device code\n  verificationUrl?: string;   // For device code\n  loginUrl?: string;          // For browser OAuth\n  instructions?: string;      // Human-readable fallback\n  expiresInSeconds?: number;\n}\n\ninterface CaamRunner {\n  listProfiles(workspaceId: string): Promise<AccountProfile[]>;\n  getStatus(workspaceId: string, provider?: ProviderId): Promise<workspaceAuthState>;\n  startLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId, mode?: AuthMode): Promise<LoginChallenge>;\n  completeLogin(workspaceId: string, provider: ProviderId): Promise<{ status: 'linked' | 'failed' }>;\n  activateProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string): Promise<void>;\n  runWithProfile(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, command: string[]): Promise<ExecResult>;\n  setCooldown(workspaceId: string, profileId: string, minutes: number, reason?: string): Promise<void>;\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- CAAM is the source of truth for auth artifacts.\n- Gateway records only metadata (status, hashes, timestamps).\n- Rotation happens at runtime by selecting the healthiest profile.\n- Runner implementation should wrap the `caam` CLI from `/data/projects/coding_agent_account_manager` and keep auth paths aligned with `caam paths` output.\n- CAAM enforces Codex file-based storage by writing `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `config.toml` within the profile's `CODEX_HOME`.\n\n### 16.4 Provider Auth Flows (BYOA)\n\n**Generic BYOA linking flow:**\n1. Gateway calls CAAM `startLogin` for the workspace/provider.\n2. UI displays device code or OAuth URL to the user.\n3. User completes auth on their own machine.\n4. CAAM detects new auth artifacts locally and marks profile `verified`.\n5. Gateway pulls metadata only (status, hashes, timestamps).\n\n**Codex (GPT Pro)**\n- Standard login: `codex login` (local browser flow).\n- Device code login: `codex login --device-auth` (headless-friendly).\n- Auth cache stored in `~/.codex/auth.json`; CAAM enforces file mode by writing `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `config.toml`.\n- CAAM uses `CODEX_HOME` to isolate profiles per agent.\n\n**Claude Code (Claude Max)**\n- Login is initiated in CLI via `/login`.\n- Credentials are stored locally by the CLI; file locations can change between releases.\n- CAAM detects the **actual** auth artifacts and records hashes.\n- API key mode is supported via `~/.claude/settings.json` with `apiKeyHelper`.\n\n**Gemini CLI**\n- Settings live in `~/.gemini/settings.json` or project `.gemini/settings.json`.\n- Auth modes: Google login, API key, or Vertex AI; `/auth` switches the method.\n- Headless containers use API key or Vertex AI (browserless).\n\n**BYOK reference (pi-mono):**\n- API key mode uses environment variables like `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.\n- Gateway should map workspace secrets into these env vars when BYOK is enabled.\n\n#### 16.4.1 Auth Artifact Discovery & Normalization\n\nCAAM does **not** hardcode auth file paths as the source of truth. It discovers and normalizes artifacts at runtime and stores **metadata only** (hash + timestamps) in Gateway.\n\n| Provider | Typical Auth Artifacts (workspace‑local) | Isolation Anchor | Notes |\n|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| **Codex** | `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`) | `HOME`, `CODEX_HOME` | CAAM enforces `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `config.toml`. |\n| **Claude** | `~/.claude.json`, `~/.config/claude-code/auth.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json` | `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | API key mode uses `settings.json` (apiKeyHelper). |\n| **Gemini** | `~/.gemini/settings.json` (or project `.gemini/settings.json`), `~/.gemini/.env` | `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | OAuth or API key mode; settings location is stable. |\n\n**Normalization rules:**\n- Track only hashes + modified timestamps (never contents).\n- If multiple artifacts exist, prefer the most recently modified set.\n- Any auth artifact change invalidates prior health score until re‑verified.\n\n#### 16.4.2 Login Modes (Provider‑Aware)\n\n**Device Code (Codex):**\n- CAAM starts device auth and returns a verification URL + code.\n- UI shows code, button to open URL, and progress indicator.\n\n**Browser OAuth (Codex default, Gemini):**\n- CAAM emits a login URL detected from CLI output.\n- User opens URL on their own machine and completes login.\n\n**Slash Command (Claude Code):**\n- User runs `/login` in the CLI; CAAM waits for new auth artifacts.\n\n**API Key / ADC (Gemini, Claude):**\n- Gemini: set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or `.gemini/.env`) or use Vertex ADC.\n- Claude: apiKeyHelper in `~/.claude/settings.json` (no OAuth artifacts).\n\n**Manual Copy (Codex fallback):**\n- User logs in on their own machine.\n- Copy `~/.codex/auth.json` into the workspace via a secure upload path.\n- CAAM records the hash and marks the profile verified (no cookies stored centrally).\n\nExample response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"provider\": \"codex\",\n  \"mode\": \"device_code\",\n  \"code\": \"B7QZ-4NJD\",\n  \"verificationUrl\": \"https://example.com/activate\",\n  \"expiresInSeconds\": 900\n}\n```\n\n#### 16.4.3 BYOA Verification Rules\n\nVerification is **local, artifact‑based**, and avoids network calls by default:\n\n1. Auth artifacts exist and are readable inside the workspace container.\n2. CAAM reports `status=verified` for at least one provider.\n3. Optional (configurable): passive expiry parsing from token metadata.\n4. Optional (configurable): active validation via minimal CLI call (off by default).\n\n#### 16.4.4 Auth Storage Modes & Keyring Policy\n\nSome CLIs can store credentials in a system keyring. This is **not** suitable for workspace‑isolated automation.\n\n**Policy:**\n- Enforce file‑based storage inside workspace containers.\n- For Codex CLI, set `cli_auth_credentials_store = \"file\"` in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `$CODEX_HOME`).\n- If keyring storage is detected, CAAM switches to file mode (provider‑specific).\n- Gateway stores `storageMode` metadata for visibility.\n- API key modes can be valid with optional-only artifacts (e.g., `.claude/settings.json`, `.gemini/.env`).\n\n#### 16.4.5 Account Multiplicity Guidance\n\nMinimum: **1 provider verified**.  \nRecommended for steady throughput: **1× Claude Max + 1× GPT Pro**.  \nScale‑up guidance: add additional accounts per provider as concurrency grows (rotation handles rate limits automatically).\n\n### 16.5 REST API Endpoints (BYOA‑aware)\n\n| Method | Endpoint | Description |\n|--------|----------|-------------|\n| `GET` | `/accounts/byoa-status` | workspace BYOA readiness (verified providers, status) |\n| `GET` | `/accounts/profiles` | List CAAM profiles (metadata only) |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/start` | Start OAuth or device‑code flow |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/providers/{provider}/login/complete` | Confirm login completion |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/activate` | Activate profile for next agent run |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/profiles/{id}/cooldown` | Cooldown profile (rate‑limit hit) |\n| `POST` | `/accounts/pools/{id}/rotate` | Force rotation to next profile |\n\n### 16.6 Rotation & Rate Limit Handling\n\nRotation is driven by CAAM health scores and cooldown timers. When a rate‑limit signature is detected in agent output, the system:\n\n1. Marks the current profile in cooldown.\n2. Selects the next healthiest profile from the pool.\n3. Replays the command (when safe).\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/caam/rotation.ts\n\nasync function handleRateLimit(ctx: RotationContext): Promise<void> {\n  await caam.setCooldown(ctx.workspaceId, ctx.profileId, ctx.cooldownMinutes, 'rate_limit');\n  const next = await caam.selectNext(ctx.workspaceId, ctx.provider);\n  await caam.activateProfile(ctx.workspaceId, next.id);\n}\n```\n\n### 16.7 Account Management UI\n\nThe UI prioritizes **BYOA readiness**:\n- Provider cards show number of verified profiles + cooldown status\n- One‑click “Link Account” flows (device code or OAuth URL)\n- Health indicators and recommended profile for each provider\n- Clear warnings when BYOA is insufficient for assignment\n\n### 16.8 BYOA UX Flow (Detailed)\n\n**Onboarding sequence:**\n1. User signs up and verifies email.\n2. Provisioning request is created (queue).\n3. Manual onboarding approval when `onboarding_mode=manual`.\n4. workspace container is provisioned + verified.\n5. UI forces **Link Accounts** step (BYOA gate).\n6. At least one provider verified → workspace assigned.\n\n**Link Account flow (device code):**\n- User selects provider → UI shows verification URL + device code.\n- User opens URL on their own machine, enters code, approves.\n- UI polls status until CAAM marks profile verified.\n\n**Link Account flow (OAuth URL):**\n- UI displays login URL captured from CLI output.\n- User opens URL on their own machine, completes login.\n- CAAM detects new auth artifacts → profile verified.\n\n**Failure modes:**\n- Expired code → UI offers “Restart login”.\n- Rate‑limit hit → CAAM cooldown + next profile selection.\n- Artifact drift → CAAM marks profile `unlinked`, UI prompts relink.\n\n**UI state model:**\n\n```\nNEEDS_ACCOUNTS → LINKING → VERIFIED\n      ↘──────── ERROR ─────↗\n```\n\n**Provider card content:**\n- Status badge: `UNLINKED | LINKING | VERIFIED | COOLDOWN | EXPIRED`\n- Primary action: `Link Account`, `Relink`, or `Rotate`\n- Secondary actions: `Copy code`, `Open URL`, `Troubleshoot`\n- Health hints: “Last verified 2h ago”, “Cooldown 43m remaining”\n\n**Copy & UX details:**\n- Device code is shown with a **copy** button and a countdown timer.\n- OAuth URL is shown with a **one‑click open** button (opens in new tab).\n- “I completed login” button triggers an immediate CAAM recheck.\n\n**UX guardrails:**\n- No dismissing the BYOA gate until minimum provider count is met.\n- Warning banner recommends adding **Claude Max + GPT Pro** for stability.\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:58:31.445805504Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T01:50:20.232808155Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:58:36.482378306Z","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.21","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:16Z","created_by":"import"}]}

Flywheel Gateway is the **orchestration backbone** of the Agent Flywheel—a self-improving development cycle where AI coding agents work in parallel, coordinate via messaging, and compound their learnings over time.\n\nThe architecture introduces:\n\n1. **Agent Driver Abstraction** — SDK, ACP, and Tmux backends behind a unified interface\n2. **Command Registry & Parity Gate** — Single source of truth for REST, WebSocket, tRPC, and OpenAPI (with AI hints)\n3. **REST API Layer** — A performant, well-documented HTTP API across **all flywheel tools**\n4. **WebSocket Layer** — Real-time streaming with durable buffering, ack/replay, and cursor-based resume\n5. **Job Orchestration** — First-class handling for long-running operations with progress events\n6. **Web UI Layer** — A world-class Vite 7.3 / React 19.2 interface with Stripe-level polish, providing unified access to the entire flywheel ecosystem\n7. **Supervisor System** — Lifecycle management for flywheel daemons\n8. **Context Pack Engine** — Token-budgeted prompt assembly from triage, memory, search, and session data\n9. **Checkpoint & Restore** — Agent state management and disaster recovery\n10. **Conflict Detection** — Real-time file conflict detection and resolution between agents\n11. **Structured Logging & Audit** — Correlation IDs, redaction, and audit trails for all mutations\n\nThe design prioritizes:\n- **SDK-first execution** — Direct API calls for programmatic control\n- **Protocol flexibility** — Agent Driver abstraction supports multiple backends\n- **Flywheel acceleration** — Every feature designed to make the virtuous cycle spin faster\n- **Full ecosystem integration** — Agent Mail, BV, UBS, CASS, CM, CAAM, SLB unified under one UI\n- **Real-time reliability** — Durable, replayable event streams with ack for critical events\n- **API parity** — Registry-driven OpenAPI with enforced AI hints and examples\n- **Auditability by default** — Structured logs and correlated audit trails across all mutations\n- **Visual excellence** — Desktop and mobile-optimized UX with separate interaction paradigms\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:00.270137321Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:05.309052005Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:05.309052005Z","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.3","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:16Z","created_by":"import"}]}

environments (developers, ops)\n2. **High contrast**: WCAG AA minimum for all text\n3. **Semantic colors**: Status and severity encoded in color\n4. **Agent identity**: Consistent visual language per agent type\n5. **Motion with purpose**: Animations indicate state, not decoration\n6. **Information density**: Optimize for at-a-glance comprehension\n\n### 22.2 Core Component Library\n\n```tsx\n//

Application Shell\n\nDuring Phase 1, the UI should run in a deterministic mock-data mode (fixtures + simulated WS events) so navigation, layouts, and information architecture can ship before all endpoints exist. As registry-backed APIs land, swap mocks to real queries one surface at a time.\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx\n\nexport function AppShell({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 768px)');\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"min-h-screen bg-slate-950 text-slate-100\">\n      {/* Desktop Sidebar */}\n      {!isMobile && <DesktopSidebar />}\n\n      {/* Main Content */}\n      <main\n        className={cn(\n          'min-h-screen',\n          !isMobile && 'ml-64'  // Sidebar width\n        )}\n      >\n        {/* Top Bar */}\n        <TopBar />\n\n        {/* Page Content */}\n        <div className=\"p-6\">\n          {children}\n        </div>\n      </main>\n\n      {/* Mobile Navigation */}\n      {isMobile && <MobileNavigation />}\n\n      {/* Global Modals */}\n      <ModalProvider />\n\n      {/* Toast Notifications */}\n      <Toaster position=\"bottom-right\" />\n\n      {/* Command Palette */}\n      <CommandPalette />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction DesktopSidebar() {\n  const location = useLocation();\n\n  return (\n    <aside className=\"fixed left-0 top-0 h-screen w-64 bg-slate-900 border-r border-slate-800 flex flex-col\">\n      {/* Logo */}\n      <div className=\"h-16 flex items-center px-6 border-b border-slate-800\">\n        <FlywheelLogo className=\"h-8\" />\n      </div>\n\n      {/* Navigation */}\n      <nav className=\"flex-1 px-3 py-4 space-y-1\">\n        {NAV_ITEMS.map(item => (\n          <NavLink\n            key={item.path}\n            to={item.path}\n            className={({ isActive }) =>\n              cn(\n                'flex items-center gap-3 px-3 py-2 rounded-lg text-sm',\n                isActive\n                  ?

Yet coordination is inherently invisible. When three agents are working on a project, users need to answer questions like:\n- \"Why is BlueLake waiting?\"\n- \"Who has src/api.ts reserved?\"\n- \"Are GreenCastle and RedStone going to conflict?\"\n\nThe Collaboration Graph makes the invisible visible.\n\n#### 22.4.1 Graph Data Model\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/types/collaboration-graph.ts\n\ninterface CollaborationGraph {\n  nodes: AgentNode[];\n  edges: CollaborationEdge[];\n  reservations: ReservationNode[];\n  conflicts: ConflictNode[];\n  handoffs: HandoffEdge[];\n  lastUpdated: Date;\n}\n\ninterface AgentNode {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'agent';\n  data: {\n    agentId: string;\n    agentName: string;\n    agentType: 'claude' | 'codex' | 'gemini';\n    status: 'idle' | 'working' | 'thinking' | 'waiting' | 'error';\n    currentTask?: string;\n    contextHealth: ContextHealthStatus;\n    lastActivity: Date;\n  };\n  position: { x: number; y: number };\n}\n\ninterface CollaborationEdge {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'message' | 'handoff' | 'dependency';\n  source: string;  // Agent ID\n  target: string;  // Agent ID\n  data: {\n    messageCount?: number;\n    lastMessageAt?: Date;\n    handoffStatus?: 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'completed';\n    animated: boolean;\n  };\n}\n\ninterface ReservationNode {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'reservation';\n  data: {\n    pattern: string;\n    holderId: string;\n    holderName: string;\n    exclusive: boolean;\n    expiresAt: Date;\n    ttlPercent: number;\n  };\n  position: { x: number; y: number };\n}\n\ninterface ConflictNode {\n  id: string;\n  type: 'conflict';\n  data: {\n    conflictId: string;\n    path: string;\n    agents: string[];\n    severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';\n    suggestedStrategy?: ConflictStrategy;\n  };\n  position: { x: number; y: number };\n}\n```\n\n#### 22.4.2 Collaboration Graph Component\n\n```tsx\n// apps/web/src/components/collaboration/CollaborationGraph.tsx\n\nimport {\n  ReactFlow,\n  Background,\n  Controls,\n  MiniMap,\n  useNodesState,\n  useEdgesState,\n  ConnectionMode,\n  Panel,\n} from '@xyflow/react';\nimport { useWebSocket } from '@/hooks/useWebSocket';\n\nconst nodeTypes = {\n  agent: AgentGraphNode,\n  reservation: ReservationGraphNode,\n  conflict: ConflictGraphNode,\n};\n\nconst edgeTypes = {\n  message: MessageEdge,\n  handoff: HandoffEdge,\n  dependency: DependencyEdge,\n};\n\nexport function CollaborationGraph({ projectKey }: { projectKey: string }) {\n  const [nodes, setNodes, onNodesChange] = useNodesState([]);\n  const [edges, setEdges, onEdgesChange] = useEdgesState([]);\n  const [viewMode, setViewMode] = useState<'agents' | 'files' | 'full'>('agents');\n\n  // Real-time updates via WebSocket\n  const { subscribe } = useWebSocket();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const unsubscribes = [\n      subscribe('agents:*', handleAgentUpdate),\n      subscribe('reservations', handleReservationUpdate),\n      subscribe('conflicts', handleConflictUpdate),\n      subscribe('handoffs', handleHandoffUpdate),\n      subscribe('mail', handleMessageUpdate),\n    ];\n\n    return () => unsubscribes.forEach(u => u());\n  }, [projectKey]);\n\n  // Fetch initial graph state\n  const { data: graphData } = useQuery({\n    queryKey: ['collaboration-graph', projectKey],\n    queryFn: () => api.getCollaborationGraph(projectKey),\n    refetchInterval: 30000, // Refresh every 30s as baseline\n  });\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!graphData) return;\n\n    const { nodes: layoutNodes, edges: layoutEdges } = computeGraphLayout(\n      graphData,\n      viewMode\n    );\n    setNodes(layoutNodes);\n    setEdges(layoutEdges);\n  }, [graphData, viewMode]);\n\n  // Real-time event handlers\n  const handleAgentUpdate = (event: AgentEvent) => {\n    setNodes(prev => prev.map(node =>\n      node.id === event.agentId\n        ?

**Protocol flexibility** — Agent Driver abstraction supports multiple backends\n3. **Flywheel-first** — Every feature accelerates the virtuous cycle\n4. **Streaming-first** — WebSocket for all real-time data; REST for commands/queries\n5. **Unified ecosystem** — All flywheel tools accessible from single UI\n6. **Type-safe end-to-end** — TypeScript from database to UI\n7. **Progressive enhancement** — Web UI enhances but doesn't replace CLI workflows\n\n### 4.3 Key Architectural Invariants\n\n- **No silent data loss** — All operations preserve data integrity\n- **Idempotency** for automation: repeated calls shouldn't spam agents\n- **All operations are auditable**: every API mutation creates a history entry and emits an event\n- **API parity is mandatory**: all capabilities originate in the Command Registry and pass the parity gate\n- **Critical events are durable and replayable**: ack/replay for approvals, conflicts, and other high-stakes topics\n- **Everything is streamable**: if it matters, it emits events and/or is queryable\n\n### 4.4 API Parity Guarantee: The Command Registry\n\nA central design principle ensures that **all operations are defined once and exposed consistently** across REST, WebSocket, and tRPC interfaces. This prevents API drift and guarantees that any capability available through one interface is available through all.\n\n#### The Command Registry Pattern\n\nEvery operation in Flywheel Gateway is registered in a central registry that drives code generation:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/shared/src/commands/registry.ts\n\ninterface CommandDefinition<TInput, TOutput> {\n  // Identity\n  name: string;                    // e.g., 'agents.spawn'\n  category: CommandCategory;       // 'agents' | 'mail' | 'beads' | 'scanner' | etc.\n  description: string;\n\n  // Schemas (Zod)\n  inputSchema: z.ZodType<TInput>;\n  outputSchema: z.ZodType<TOutput>;\n\n  // REST binding\n  rest: {\n    method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'PATCH' | 'DELETE';\n    path: string;                  // e.g., '/agents'\n    pathParams?: string[];         // e.g., ['id'] for '/agents/{id}'\n  };\n\n  // WebSocket binding (optional)\n  ws?: {\n    emitsEvents: string[];         // Events this command triggers\n    subscribeTopic?: string;       // Topic for streaming results\n  };\n\n  // Behavior metadata\n  idempotent: boolean;\n  safetyLevel: 'safe' | 'requires_confirmation' | 'dangerous';\n  longRunning: boolean;            // Returns job ID instead of result\n\n  // Documentation for AI agents\n  aiHints: {\n    whenToUse: string;\n    commonMistakes: string[];\n    prerequisites: string[];       // Commands to call first\n    followUp: string[];            // Commands typically called after\n  };\n\n  // Handler\n  handler: (ctx: Context, input: TInput) => Promise<TOutput>;\n}\n\n// Example registration\nexport const spawnAgent = defineCommand({\n  name: 'agents.spawn',\n  category: 'agents',\n  description: 'Spawn a new AI coding agent',\n\n  inputSchema: z.object({\n    model: z.enum(['claude', 'codex', 'gemini']),\n    workingDir: z.string(),\n    driver: z.enum(['sdk', 'acp', 'tmux']).optional(),\n    contextPack: z.string().optional(),\n  }),\n\n  outputSchema: z.object({\n    id: z.string(),\n    model: z.string(),\n    status: z.enum(['starting', 'running']),\n    driver: z.string(),\n  }),\n\n  rest: {\n    method: 'POST',\n    path: '/agents',\n  },\n\n  ws: {\n    emitsEvents: ['agent.spawned', 'agent.state_changed'],\n    subscribeTopic: 'agents:{id}',\n  },\n\n  idempotent: false,\n  safetyLevel: 'safe',\n  longRunning: false,\n\n  aiHints: {\n    whenToUse: 'When you need to start a new coding agent to work on a task',\n    commonMistakes: [\n      'Not specifying workingDir (defaults to cwd)',\n      'Spawning multiple agents on same file without coordination',\n    ],\n    prerequisites: [],\n    followUp: ['agents.send', 'reservations.create'],\n  },\n\n  handler: async (ctx, input) => {\n    return ctx.agentService.spawn(input);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Code Generation from Registry\n\nThe registry enables automatic generation of:\n\n1. **REST Routes** — Hono routes with Zod validation\n2. **tRPC Procedures** — Type-safe procedures with inference\n3. **OpenAPI Spec** — Complete spec with examples and AI hints\n4. **TypeScript Client** — Fully typed API client\n5. **WebSocket Handlers** — Event subscription setup\n\n```typescript\n// apps/gateway/src/routes/generated.ts (auto-generated)\n\nimport { commands } from '@flywheel/shared/commands';\nimport { Hono } from 'hono';\n\nexport const generatedRoutes = new Hono();\n\nfor (const cmd of commands) {\n  const { method, path } = cmd.rest;\n\n  generatedRoutes[method.toLowerCase()](path, async (c) => {\n    const input = await c.req.json();\n    const validated = cmd.inputSchema.parse(input);\n    const result = await cmd.handler(c, validated);\n    return c.json({ data: result, request_id: c.get('requestId') });\n  });\n}\n```\n\n#### Parity Gate: CI Enforcement\n\nThe build fails if parity is violated:\n\n```typescript\n// scripts/parity-check.ts\n\nimport { commands, CommandDefinition } from '@flywheel/shared/commands';\n\nconst violations: string[] = [];\n\nfor (const cmd of commands) {\n  // Every command must have REST binding\n  if (!cmd.rest) {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Missing REST binding`);\n  }\n\n  // Every command must have AI hints\n  if (!cmd.aiHints?.whenToUse) {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Missing AI hints`);\n  }\n\n  // Destructive commands must not be 'safe'\n  if (cmd.rest?.method === 'DELETE' && cmd.safetyLevel === 'safe') {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: DELETE should not be marked 'safe'`);\n  }\n\n  // Long-running commands must specify job handling\n  if (cmd.longRunning && !cmd.outputSchema.shape.jobId) {\n    violations.push(`${cmd.name}: Long-running command must return jobId`);\n  }\n}\n\nif (violations.length > 0) {\n  console.error('❌ Parity violations detected:');\n  violations.forEach(v => console.error(`  - ${v}`));\n  process.exit(1);\n}\n\nconsole.log('✅ All commands pass parity checks');\n```\n\nThis pattern ensures that **new features automatically get full API coverage** — if a developer adds a command to the registry, it's immediately available via REST, WebSocket, and tRPC.\n\n---\n","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:25.566532641Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:30.603308195Z","closed_at":"2026-01-09T00:57:30.603308195Z","close_reason":"Embedded docs/PLAN.md section into Beads","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"labels":["spec-plan"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19.8","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-y19","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:16Z","created_by":"import"}]}

While functional, error messages and connection handling could be more helpful for developers and AI agents.\n\n### Current State Analysis\n\n**Current Error Messages (ws/handlers.ts):**\n```typescript\nconst errorMsg: ServerMessage = {\n  type: \"error\",\n  code: \"INVALID_FORMAT\",\n  message: \"Invalid message format\",\n};\n\nconst errorMsg: ServerMessage = {\n  type: \"error\",\n  code: \"FORBIDDEN\",\n  message: `Subscription denied: ${authResult.reason}`,\n  channel: channelStr,\n};\n```\n\n**Problems:**\n1. No example of valid format provided\n2. No link to documentation\n3. No hint about how to fix the issue\n4. Error codes are strings, not from canonical taxonomy\n\n**Current Message Types (ws/messages.ts):**\nThe message types are well-defined but could include:\n- Schema version for compatibility checking\n- Compression hints for large messages\n- Retry guidance for connection issues\n\n### Improvement Opportunities\n\n1. **Enhanced Error Messages:**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"error\",\n  \"code\": \"INVALID_FORMAT\",\n  \"message\": \"Invalid message format\",\n  \"hint\": \"Messages must be JSON with 'type' field\",\n  \"example\": {\"type\": \"subscribe\", \"channel\": \"agent:output:AGENT_ID\"},\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.flywheel.dev/websocket#messages\"\n}\n```\n\n2. **Connection State Clarity:**\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"connected\",\n  \"connectionId\": \"conn_abc123\",\n  \"serverTime\": \"2024-01-11T...\",\n  \"serverVersion\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"capabilities\": [\"compression\", \"backfill\"],\n  \"heartbeatIntervalMs\": 30000\n}\n```\n\n3. **Backpressure Indication:**\nWhen client sends too fast, indicate throttling:\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"throttled\",\n  \"message\": \"Slow down message rate\",\n  \"resumeAfterMs\": 1000\n}\n```\n\n## Goals\n1. **Helpful Errors**: Every error tells you how to fix it\n2. **Connection Clarity**: Client knows server capabilities\n3. **Self-Documenting**: Examples in error messages\n4. **Graceful Degradation**: Clear backpressure signals\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Error messages include `hint` field\n- [ ] Error messages include `example` where appropriate\n- [ ] Connected message includes server version and capabilities\n- [ ] Throttle/backpressure messages defined\n- [ ] Tests cover error scenarios\n- [ ] Documentation updated\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Extend ServerMessage types with new fields\n2. Update handleWSMessage error responses\n3. Enhance handleWSOpen welcome message\n4. Add throttling message type\n5. Update ws/messages.ts type definitions\n\n## New Message Types Needed\n- `throttled`: Backpressure indication\n- Enhanced `connected`: Include capabilities\n- Enhanced `error`: Include hints and examples\n\n## Dependencies\n- AI Hints Epic (for error hint patterns)\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n- **Breaking Change**: New fields in messages\n  - Mitigation: Additive only, old clients ignore new fields\n- **Message Size**: Adding fields increases overhead\n  - Mitigation: Keep examples small, hints concise","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-11T14:59:55.288070075Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T06:52:17.732668431Z","closed_at":"2026-01-12T06:52:17.732668431Z","close_reason":"WebSocket UX improvements complete: error hints, examples, docs links, connected message enhancements, and throttle message type","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"flywheel_gateway-ynm","depends_on_id":"flywheel_gateway-1n6","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-30T01:11:16Z","created_by":"import"}]}

{"id":"flywheel_gateway-zno","title":"RU (Repo Updater) Integration","description":"## Overview\n\nRU (Repo Updater) Integration brings fleet management capabilities to Flywheel Gateway, enabling synchronized operations across multiple repositories. This is essential for organizations managing microservices architectures or monorepo ecosystems where changes must propagate consistently.\n\n## Background & Reasoning\n\nModern software organizations often manage dozens or hundreds of repositories. When making cross-cutting changes (dependency updates, security patches, API migrations), manual coordination becomes impractical. RU provides:\n\n- Centralized visibility into repository health across the fleet\n- Automated synchronization with intelligent conflict handling\n- Agent-sweep orchestration for bulk operations\n- Approval workflows for safe execution\n\nThe integration with Flywheel Gateway allows AI agents to participate in fleet-wide operations under human supervision.\n\n## Repository Status Model\n\nEach repository in the fleet can be in one of six states:\n\n```typescript\ntype RepositoryStatus = \n  | 'current'   // Up-to-date with upstream, clean working tree\n  | 'behind'    // Local is behind upstream, no local changes\n  | 'ahead'     // Local has unpushed commits\n  | 'diverged'  // Both local and upstream have new commits\n  | 'dirty'     // Uncommitted local changes\n  | 'conflict'; // Merge conflicts present\n```\n\n## Agent-Sweep Orchestration\n\nThe three-phase agent-sweep model ensures safe bulk operations:\n\n### Phase 1: Analyze\n- Scan all fleet repositories for status\n- Identify candidates for operation (e.g., repos with outdated dependency)\n- Generate impact assessment report\n- No modifications made\n\n### Phase 2: Plan\n- Generate specific changes for each repository\n- Create preview branches with proposed changes\n- Run CI validation on preview branches\n- Produce human-readable diff summaries\n\n### Phase 3: Execute\n- **REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL**\n- Apply planned changes to target branches\n- Create PRs or direct commits as configured\n- Report success/failure per repository\n- Rollback support for failed operations\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### Fleet Service\n\n```typescript\ninterface FleetService {\n  // Fleet Discovery\n  discoverRepositories(config: DiscoveryConfig): Promise<Repository[]>;\n  addRepository(repo: RepositoryConfig): Promise<Repository>;\n  removeRepository(repoId: string): Promise<void>;\n  \n  // Status Tracking\n  getFleetStatus(): Promise<FleetStatusReport>;\n  getRepositoryStatus(repoId: string): Promise<RepositoryStatus>;\n  watchFleetStatus(callback: StatusCallback): Unsubscribe;\n  \n  // Sync Operations\n  syncRepository(repoId: string, options: SyncOptions): Promise<SyncResult>;\n  syncFleet(options: FleetSyncOptions): Promise<FleetSyncResult>;\n  \n  // Agent-Sweep\n  startSweep(config: SweepConfig): Promise<Sweep>;\n  advanceSweepPhase(sweepId: string): Promise<Sweep>;\n  approveSweepExecution(sweepId: string, approver: User): Promise<Sweep>;\n  cancelSweep(sweepId: string): Promise<void>;\n}\n\ninterface Sweep {\n  id: string;\n  phase: 'analyze' | 'plan' | 'execute' | 'complete' | 'cancelled';\n  repositories: SweepRepository[];\n  createdAt: Date;\n  approvedBy?: User;\n  approvedAt?: Date;\n  results?: SweepResults;\n}\n\ninterface SweepRepository {\n  repository: Repository;\n  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'success' | 'failed' | 'skipped';\n  analysis?: AnalysisResult;\n  plan?: PlanResult;\n  execution?: ExecutionResult;\n}\n```\n\n### Approval Workflow\n\nPhase 3 execution requires explicit human approval:\n\n1. Sweep reaches 'plan' phase completion\n2. System generates approval request with:\n   - Summary of all planned changes\n   - Risk assessment score\n   - Affected repository list\n   - Rollback procedure\n3. Authorized user reviews and approves/rejects\n4. Approval recorded with user identity and timestamp\n5. Execution proceeds or sweep cancelled\n\n## Frontend Components\n\n### FleetDashboard.tsx\n- Grid view of all fleet repositories\n- Status indicators with color coding\n- Quick filters (by status, by tag, by team)\n- Bulk action controls\n\n### SweepWizard.tsx\n- Step-by-step sweep configuration\n- Phase progress visualization\n- Approval interface for Phase 3\n- Results summary view\n\n### RepositoryCard.tsx\n- Individual repository status display\n- Quick sync actions\n- Recent operation history\n- Link to repository details\n\n### FleetStatusChart.tsx\n- Aggregate fleet health visualization\n- Trend graphs for sync status over time\n- Alert indicators for attention-needed repos\n\n## File Locations\n\n- `apps/gateway/src/services/fleet.service.ts` -
